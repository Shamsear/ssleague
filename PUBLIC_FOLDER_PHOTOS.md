## 📂 Structure

```
public/
└── images/
    └── players/
        ├── 12345.jpg
        ├── 67890.png
        ├── 11111.webp
        └── .gitkeep
```

## 🌐 Accessing Photos

Photos are accessible at: `/images/players/{player_id}.{ext}`

### Examples:
```html
<img src="/images/players/12345.jpg" alt="Player" />
<img src="/images/players/67890.png" alt="Player" />
<img src="/images/players/11111.webp" alt="Player" />
```

### In React/Next.js:
```tsx
<img src={`/images/players/${playerId}.jpg`} alt="Player photo" />
```

## 📤 Upload Process

### Committee Admin:
1. Go to **Dashboard → Database Management**
2. Scroll to **"Bulk Player Photo Management"**
3. Select multiple photos
4. Click "Upload Photos"
5. Photos saved to `public/images/players/`

### API Endpoint:
```
POST /api/players/photos/upload-public
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

---

## 🗑️ Delete Process

### Committee Admin:
1. Click "Delete All Photos" button
2. Confirm twice (safety measure)
3. All photos deleted from `public/images/players/`

### API Endpoint:
```
POST /api/players/photos/delete-public
Content-Type: application/json

Body: { "deleteAll": true }
```

---

## 🔒 Git Ignore

Photos are **NOT** committed to Git (to avoid repository bloat):

`.gitignore` includes:
```
/public/images/players/
!public/images/players/.gitkeep
```

This means:
- ✅ Directory structure preserved
- ❌ Photos not pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Each environment manages its own photos

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### On Vercel:
Photos uploaded via the admin panel will be stored on the server but **NOT** persist across deployments.

### Solution for Production:
1. **Option A**: Upload photos after each deployment
2. **Option B**: Use a persistent storage (Vercel Blob) for production
3. **Option C**: Commit essential player photos to Git (small set)

### Recommended:
For development: Use public folder (FREE)  
For production: Upgrade to Vercel Blob when needed

---

## 📊 Comparison

### Development (Current Setup):
✅ **100% FREE**  
✅ **No limits**  
✅ **Fast**  
⚠️ Photos not persistent across deployments  

### Production (Future - if needed):
- Switch to Vercel Blob (1GB free)
- Or upgrade to paid storage when needed

---

## 💾 Backup Strategy

Since photos are not in Git:

1. **Manual Backup**:
   - Download `public/images/players/` folder
   - Keep local backup

2. **Automated Backup** (optional):
   - Create backup script
   - Export to JSON with base64 images
   - Store in safe location

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Name files correctly**: `player_id.ext`
2. **Compress images**: Keep under 500KB each
3. **Use consistent format**: Prefer WebP or JPG
4. **Regular backups**: Download photos periodically
5. **Test after deployment**: Re-upload if needed

---

## 🔄 Migration Path

If you outgrow public folder:

### Current (FREE):
```
public/images/players/12345.jpg
```

### Future (Vercel Blob):
```
https://blob.vercel-storage.com/.../player-photos/12345.jpg
```

Simply update the API endpoints - no frontend changes needed!
