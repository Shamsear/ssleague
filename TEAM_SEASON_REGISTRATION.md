# Team Season Registration Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the team season registration flow that allows committees to invite teams to join specific seasons via invitation links.

## Flow

### 1. Committee Generates Invitation Link
- Committee admin creates a season
- System generates invitation link: `/register/team?season=<seasonId>`
- Committee shares this link with teams

### 2. Team Receives Invitation
- Team clicks the invitation link
- Must be logged in (redirected to login if not)
- Must have 'team' role (redirected to dashboard if not)

### 3. Team Views Season Details
- **Frontend**: `app/register/team/page.tsx`
- **API**: `GET /api/seasons/[seasonId]`
- Displays:
  - Season name and status
  - Starting balance (Â£15,000)
  - Team information
  - Season features and expectations
  - Important notes about decision finality

### 4. Team Makes Decision
- **Join Season**: Team gets registered with starting balance
- **Decline Season**: Recorded as declined, can join future seasons

### 5. Registration Processing
- **API**: `POST /api/seasons/[seasonId]/register`
- Creates record in `team_seasons` collection
- Updates season participant count (if joining)
- Redirects to team dashboard
