## üîÑ Typical Workflow

### Before Match
1. Team captain navigates to `/dashboard/team/fixture/[fixtureId]/lineup`
2. Selects 5 starters + 2 subs (min 2 classic)
3. Submits lineup before deadline
4. Committee monitors via `/dashboard/committee/lineups`

### Deadline Passes
1. User loads any fixture page
2. `useAutoLockLineups` hook checks deadline
3. If passed, calls `/api/lineups/auto-lock`
4. Lineups automatically locked in database
5. No further edits allowed

### During Match
1. Team navigates to `/dashboard/team/fixture/[fixtureId]/substitutions`
2. Drags player from subs to replace starter
3. Confirms substitution (with penalty display)
4. Substitution recorded in database

### After Match Results
1. Results are entered via fixture page
2. System calls `/api/fixtures/[fixtureId]/record-participation`
3. Updates `realplayerstats` with participation data
4. Only `started` or `subbed_in` players count toward stats

### Audit & History
1. Committee views `/dashboard/committee/lineup-history`
2. Switch between lineup submissions and substitutions
3. See complete audit trail with timestamps
