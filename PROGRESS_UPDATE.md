**Last Updated**: 2025-10-09 09:48  
**Status**: Phase 2 Complete ✅

---

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 1: Database Setup
- [x] Created `bulk_tiebreakers` table
- [x] Created `bulk_tiebreaker_teams` table  
- [x] Created `bulk_tiebreaker_bids` table
- [x] Helper functions for winner detection

### Phase 2: Admin Bulk Round APIs
- [x] `POST /api/admin/bulk-rounds` - Create round + auto-add ALL players
- [x] `GET /api/admin/bulk-rounds` - List bulk rounds
- [x] `POST /api/admin/bulk-rounds/:id/start` - Start bidding period
- [x] `POST /api/admin/bulk-rounds/:id/finalize` - Detect conflicts, assign singles, create tiebreakers

## 📂 Files Created (Phase 2)

1. **`/app/api/admin/bulk-rounds/route.ts`**
   - POST: Create bulk round
   - GET: List bulk rounds
   - ~287 lines

2. **`/app/api/admin/bulk-rounds/[id]/start/route.ts`**
   - POST: Start bulk round
   - Sets status to 'active'
   - Calculates start/end times
   - ~130 lines

3. **`/app/api/admin/bulk-rounds/[id]/finalize/route.ts`**
   - POST: Finalize bulk round
   - Analyzes all bids
   - Assigns players with single bidders immediately (deduct £10)
   - Creates tiebreakers for conflicts (no deduction yet)
   - ~301 lines

## 🎯 What Works Now

### Committee Admin Can:
1. ✅ Create a bulk round → Automatically adds ALL eligible players
2. ✅ Start the round → Teams can bid (we'll build this next)
3. ✅ Finalize the round → System:
   - Detects conflicts (multiple teams bid same player)
   - Assigns non-conflicted players immediately
   - Creates tiebreaker records for conflicts
   - Updates round status to 'pending_tiebreakers' or 'completed'

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Phase 3: Team Bidding API (1 endpoint) - NEXT
```
POST /api/team/bulk-rounds/:id/bids
- Teams submit multiple player IDs
- Validate squad limit (25 players max)
- Validate balance (£10 per player)
- Insert into round_bids table
```

### Phase 4: Tiebreaker APIs (4 endpoints)
```
POST /api/admin/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/start
POST /api/team/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/bid
POST /api/team/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/withdraw
POST /api/admin/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/force-finalize
```

### Phase 5: WebSocket (Real-time)
- Live auction updates
- Broadcast bids to all teams

### Phase 6: UI Integration
- Connect existing pages to new APIs

### Phase 7: Testing
- End-to-end testing

## 🧪 How to Test Phase 2

### 1. Create Bulk Round
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/bulk-rounds \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "season_id": "YOUR_SEASON_ID",
    "base_price": 10,
    "duration_seconds": 300
  }'
```

**Expected**: Round created with ALL eligible players added

### 2. List Bulk Rounds
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/bulk-rounds?season_id=YOUR_SEASON_ID
```

**Expected**: Array of bulk rounds with player counts

### 3. Start Round
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/bulk-rounds/ROUND_ID/start
```

**Expected**: Status changes to 'active', start/end times set

### 4. Finalize Round (after teams place bids)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/bulk-rounds/ROUND_ID/finalize
```

**Expected**: 
- Single bidders assigned immediately
- Conflicts create tiebreakers
- Status changes to 'pending_tiebreakers' or 'completed'

## 💡 Key Implementation Notes

### Finalize Logic:
1. **Fetches all bids** for the round from `round_bids`
2. **Groups by player** to detect conflicts
3. **Single bidders** (1 team):
   - Updates `round_players`: winning_team_id, winning_bid, status='sold'
   - Updates `footballplayers`: is_sold=true, team_id, acquisition_value
   - Deducts £10 from team (TODO: implement Firebase balance update)
4. **Multiple bidders** (2+ teams):
   - Creates record in `bulk_tiebreakers`
   - Adds all teams to `bulk_tiebreaker_teams` with status='active'
   - NO money deducted yet (only after tiebreaker resolves)
5. **No bidders**:
   - Marks as 'unsold' in `round_players`

---

## 🚀 Ready for Phase 3

We can now proceed to build the team bidding API which will:
- Let teams select multiple players
- Validate they have enough balance
- Validate squad limit (25 players)
- Insert bids into `round_bids` table

**Estimated time**: 30-45 minutes
