# 🎉 Automatic News Generation for Season Events

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

News is now **automatically generated** for season lifecycle events when tournaments are created or updated.

---

## 🔄 Automatic Triggers

### 1. **Tournament Creation** (`POST /api/tournaments`)
When a **primary tournament** is created (usually the main league):
- ✅ Generates **"Season Created"** news
- ✅ Bilingual content (English + Malayalam)
- ✅ AI-generated image
- ✅ Auto-published

**Example:**
```bash
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS8",
  "tournament_type": "league",
  "tournament_name": "Season 8 League",
  "is_primary": true,
  "status": "upcoming"
}
```
→ **Automatically generates news** announcing Season 8 creation

---

### 2. **Tournament Status → Active** (`PATCH /api/tournaments/[id]`)
When a **primary tournament** status is changed to `"active"`:
- ✅ Generates **"Season Active"** news
- ✅ Announces the season has officially begun
- ✅ Prevents duplicate news

**Example:**
```bash
PATCH /api/tournaments/SSPSLS8L
{
  "status": "active"
}
```
→ **Automatically generates news** announcing Season 8 is now active

---

### 3. **Tournament Status → Completed** (`PATCH /api/tournaments/[id]`)
When a **primary tournament** status is changed to `"completed"`:
- ✅ Generates **"Season Complete"** news
- ✅ Includes season statistics (teams, players, matches)
- ✅ Celebrates season conclusion

**Example:**
```bash
PATCH /api/tournaments/SSPSLS8L
{
  "status": "completed"
}
```
→ **Automatically generates news** announcing Season 8 completion with stats

---

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. **Created:**
- `lib/news/season-events.ts` - News generation functions
- `app/api/news/season-events/route.ts` - Manual trigger endpoint

### 2. **Modified:**
- `app/api/tournaments/route.ts` - Added auto-news on creation
- `app/api/tournaments/[id]/route.ts` - Added auto-news on status change

---

## 🎛️ How It Works

1. **Non-blocking** - News generation runs asynchronously, doesn't delay API responses
2. **Primary tournaments only** - Only generates news for `is_primary: true` tournaments
3. **Duplicate prevention** - Checks if news already exists before generating
4. **Error handling** - Failures are logged but don't break the API

## 🧪 Testing

### Create a New Season:
```bash
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS9",
  "tournament_type": "league",
  "tournament_name": "Season 9 League",
  "is_primary": true,
  "status": "upcoming"
}
```
✅ Check `/api/news?season_id=SSPSLS9` - Should see creation news

### Activate a Season:
```bash
PATCH /api/tournaments/SSPSLS9L
{
  "status": "active"
}
```
✅ Check `/api/news?season_id=SSPSLS9` - Should see activation news

### Complete a Season:
```bash
PATCH /api/tournaments/SSPSLS9L
{
  "status": "completed"
}
```
✅ Check `/api/news?season_id=SSPSLS9` - Should see completion news with stats

## 🎨 What Gets Generated

Each news article includes:
- ✅ **Bilingual titles** (English + Malayalam)
- ✅ **Bilingual content** (Full article in both languages)
- ✅ **Bilingual summaries**
- ✅ **Reporter names** (Varied AI reporters)
- ✅ **Tone** (Professional, enthusiastic, etc.)
- ✅ **AI-generated images**
- ✅ **Category & event type** metadata

---

## 🔧 Manual Trigger (Optional)

You can still manually trigger news generation:

```bash
POST /api/news/season-events
{
  "event_type": "created",  // or "active" or "complete"
  "season_id": "SSPSLS9",
  "season_name": "Season 9"
}
```

3. **Bilingual support** - Reaches both English and Malayalam audiences
4. **Professional content** - AI-generated varied writing styles
