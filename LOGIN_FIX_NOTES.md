# Login Fix - Documentation

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Login Redirect Issue
**Problem:** After successful login, users were staying on the login page instead of being redirected to their dashboard.

**Solution:**
- Added a 500ms delay after `signIn()` to allow auth state to fully update
- Changed from `router.push('/dashboard')` to `window.location.href = '/dashboard'` for a hard redirect
- This ensures the auth context is fully updated before navigation

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD:
await signIn(email, password);
router.push('/dashboard');

// NEW:
await signIn(email, password);
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500));
window.location.href = '/dashboard';
```

### 2. ✅ Removed Email Login
**Problem:** Login form accepted both username and email, but you wanted username-only login.

**Solution:**
- Removed email detection logic (`username.includes('@')`)
- Changed label from "Username or Email" to just "Username"
- Changed placeholder from "Enter username or email" to "Enter your username"
- Removed helper text about using either username or email
- Simplified error messages to only mention username

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// OLD:
if (username.includes('@')) {
  email = username;
} else {
  const foundEmail = await getEmailFromUsername(username);
  email = foundEmail;
}

// NEW:
const email = await getEmailFromUsername(username);
// Always look up email from username
```

### 3. ✅ Improved Error Messages
Updated all error messages to remove references to email:
- "Invalid email/username or password" → "Invalid username or password"
- "Username not found. Please check your username or use your email address" → "Username not found. Please check your username"
- Removed permission error fallback to email

## How Login Works Now

1. **User enters username** (not email)
2. **System looks up email** from username in database
3. **Firebase auth** uses the email (internally) to authenticate
4. **Success redirect** uses `window.location.href` for reliable navigation
5. **Dashboard router** detects user role and redirects to appropriate dashboard:
   - Super Admin → `/dashboard/superadmin`
   - Committee Admin → `/dashboard/committee`
   - Team → `/dashboard/team`

## Files Modified

- `components/auth/Login.tsx` - Updated login logic and UI

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Enter a valid username (not email)
3. Enter password
4. Click "Sign In"
5. You should be redirected to your role-specific dashboard

## Notes

- The system still uses Firebase Authentication with email/password internally
- The username is just a user-friendly way to identify users
- The email lookup happens via `getEmailFromUsername()` function
- If username is not found, user gets clear error message
- No email input is accepted anymore - username only!
