# Fixes Applied - All Teams Page & Dashboard Links

## Issue 1: All Teams Page Error ❌ → ✅ Fixed

### Problem
- Error: "You are not registered for any season"
- Page was trying to find user's registered team_season to get seasonId
- This doesn't work for viewing ALL teams (should show all teams regardless of registration)

### Solution
Changed the logic to match `team-leaderboard` page:
- **Before**: Looked for user's registered team_season
- **After**: Gets active season from seasons collection directly

### Code Changes
```typescript
// OLD APPROACH (WRONG)
const registeredSeason = userTeamSeasons.find(
  (ts: any) => ts.team_id === user.uid && ts.status === 'registered'
);
if (!registeredSeason) {
  setError('You are not registered for any season'); // ❌ ERROR
  return;
}

// NEW APPROACH (CORRECT)
// Get all seasons, find non-completed ones
const seasonsQuery = query(collection(db, 'seasons'));
const seasonsSnapshot = await getDocs(seasonsQuery);

// Filter for active seasons (status !== 'completed')
const nonCompletedSeasonIds = seasons.filter(s => s.status !== 'completed');

// Use first active season
setSeasonId(nonCompletedSeasonIds[0]);
```

### Why This Works
- All teams page should show ALL teams in the active season
- Doesn't matter if current user is registered or not
- Matches behavior of team-leaderboard and player-leaderboard pages
