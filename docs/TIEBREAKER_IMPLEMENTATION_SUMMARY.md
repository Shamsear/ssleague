## 🎯 Core Features Implemented

### Last Person Standing Mechanism

✅ **Bidding Rules**
- All tied teams automatically entered
- Starting bid = tie amount + £1
- Each bid must be higher than current highest
- Full bid history tracked

✅ **Withdrawal Rules**
- **CRITICAL**: Highest bidder CANNOT withdraw
- Other teams can withdraw at any time
- Withdrawal immediately removes team from auction

✅ **Winner Determination**
- Last team standing (all others withdrawn)
- OR highest bidder after 24 hours
- Auto-detection of winner conditions

✅ **Time Limits**
- 24-hour maximum from start
- Countdown timer calculation
- Prevents bids after expiration

✅ **Balance Validation**
- Checks team balance before accepting bid
- Prevents overbidding
- Integration with team_seasons balance

---

## 🔐 Security & Validation

### Admin Endpoints
- ✅ Committee admin role verification
- ✅ Status validation (pending → active → completed)
- ✅ Minimum team count check (≥2)
- ✅ Player allocation updates
- ✅ Balance deduction on finalization

### Team Endpoints
- ✅ Team role verification
- ✅ Participation verification
- ✅ Active status checks
- ✅ Balance sufficiency checks
- ✅ Bid amount validation
- ✅ Highest bidder withdrawal prevention
- ✅ Time limit enforcement

---

## 📊 Database Integration

### Tables Used
- `bulk_tiebreakers` - Main tiebreaker records
- `bulk_tiebreaker_teams` - Team participation
- `bulk_tiebreaker_bids` - Bid history
- `auction_rounds` - Round metadata
- `bulk_team_bids` - Original bulk bids

### Helper Functions
- `check_tiebreaker_winner()` - Winner detection
- Triggers for updated_at timestamps

---

## 🔄 API Flow Examples

### Admin Starting a Tiebreaker
```
1. Admin views pending tiebreakers
2. Admin starts tiebreaker via POST /api/admin/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/start
3. Status changes: pending → active
4. Start time and max_end_time recorded (24 hours)
5. Teams notified (TODO: WebSocket/notifications)
```

### Team Bidding Flow
```
1. Team views tiebreaker details
2. Team sees current highest bid: £100
3. Team places bid: £110 via POST /api/team/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/bid
4. Validations:
   - Tiebreaker is active ✅
   - Team not withdrawn ✅
   - Bid > current highest ✅
   - Team has balance ✅
5. Bid recorded, team becomes highest bidder
6. Team now CANNOT withdraw
7. Other teams notified of new bid (TODO: WebSocket)
```

### Team Withdrawal Flow
```
1. Team wants to withdraw
2. POST /api/team/bulk-tiebreakers/:id/withdraw
3. Validations:
   - Tiebreaker is active ✅
   - Team not already withdrawn ✅
   - Team is NOT highest bidder ✅ (CRITICAL CHECK)
4. Team status: active → withdrawn
5. Check if only 1 team remains
6. If yes → Flag for auto-finalize
```

## 🎨 Frontend Integration Guide

### Key UI Components Needed

1. **Tiebreaker List Page**
   - Shows all tiebreakers (grouped by status)
   - Filters: active, completed, pending
   - Quick actions: View details

2. **Tiebreaker Detail Page**
   - Player information
   - Current highest bid
   - Countdown timer (24 hours)
   - Your current bid
   - Can bid/withdraw status
   - Participating teams list
   - Recent bid history (last 10)

3. **Bid Modal/Form**
   - Input field for bid amount
   - Minimum bid indicator (current + 1)
   - Balance check
   - Confirmation dialog

4. **Withdraw Confirmation**
   - Warning: "Are you sure?"
   - Cannot undo
   - Only enabled if not highest bidder

### Real-time Updates (TODO)
```typescript
// WebSocket subscription example
socket.on('tiebreaker:bid', (data) => {
  // Update UI with new bid
  // Show notification
  // Update highest bidder
  // Refresh can_bid/can_withdraw status
});

socket.on('tiebreaker:withdraw', (data) => {
  // Update team list
  // Check for winner
  // Show notification
});

socket.on('tiebreaker:complete', (data) => {
  // Show winner banner
  // Disable bid/withdraw buttons
});
```

## 🎯 Key Business Rules Enforced

1. ✅ **Starting Bid**: Always tie_amount + 1
2. ✅ **Minimum Increment**: New bid must be > current highest
3. ✅ **No Withdrawal for Leader**: Highest bidder cannot withdraw
4. ✅ **24-Hour Limit**: Maximum auction duration
5. ✅ **Balance Validation**: Teams cannot overbid
6. ✅ **Winner Takes All**: Only one winner per tiebreaker
7. ✅ **Automatic Winner**: Last team standing wins immediately

---

## 🔍 Known Limitations

1. **No Bid Increments**: Currently no minimum increment (e.g., +£1), only "higher than current"
2. **Manual Finalization**: Admin must manually finalize after 24 hours (cron job TODO)
3. **No Real-time Updates**: Teams must refresh to see new bids (WebSocket TODO)
4. **No Email Notifications**: Teams not automatically notified (TODO)
5. **No Undo**: Once withdrawn, cannot rejoin (by design)
