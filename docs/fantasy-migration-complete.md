## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### PostgreSQL Schema (Neon Fantasy DB)

```sql
-- Core Tables
fantasy_leagues           -- League configuration
fantasy_teams            -- Team records with ranks/points
fantasy_squad            -- Drafted players
fantasy_player_points    -- Per-player, per-fixture points
fantasy_scoring_rules    -- Configurable scoring
fantasy_player_prices    -- Player valuations
fantasy_transfers        -- Transfer records
transfer_windows         -- Transfer periods

-- Key Indexes
league_id, fantasy_team_id, round_number, player_id
```

### Cross-Database Integration
- **Fantasy DB (Neon)**: Fantasy league data
- **Tournament DB (Neon)**: Real players, fixtures, matchups
- **Firestore**: Only team metadata (for backward compatibility)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Connection
```typescript
// lib/neon/fantasy-config.ts
import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';

export function getFantasyDb() {
  return neon(process.env.NEON_FANTASY_DATABASE_URL!);
}
```

### Example: Optimized Leaderboard Query
```typescript
const leaderboard = await sql`
  SELECT 
    ft.id as fantasy_team_id,
    ft.team_name,
    ft.owner_name,
    ft.total_points,
    ft.rank,
    COUNT(DISTINCT fs.real_player_id) as player_count,
    COALESCE(
      (SELECT SUM(fpp.total_points)
       FROM fantasy_player_points fpp
       WHERE fpp.fantasy_team_id = ft.id
         AND fpp.round_number = (
           SELECT MAX(round_number)
           FROM fantasy_player_points
           WHERE fantasy_team_id = ft.id
         )
      ), 0
    ) as last_round_points
  FROM fantasy_teams ft
  LEFT JOIN fantasy_squad fs ON ft.id = fs.fantasy_team_id
  WHERE ft.league_id = ${leagueId}
  GROUP BY ft.id, ft.team_name, ft.owner_name, ft.total_points, ft.rank
  ORDER BY ft.rank ASC NULLS LAST, ft.total_points DESC
`;
```

### Example: Points Calculation
```typescript
// Insert points
await sql`
  INSERT INTO fantasy_player_points (
    league_id, fantasy_team_id, real_player_id,
    player_name, fixture_id, round_number,
    goals_scored, goals_conceded, result,
    is_motm, total_points, points_breakdown
  ) VALUES (...)
`;

// Update team totals
await sql`
  UPDATE fantasy_teams
  SET 
    player_points = player_points + ${points},
    total_points = total_points + ${points},
    updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = ${teamId}
`;

// Recalculate ranks
await sql`
  UPDATE fantasy_teams
  SET rank = ${rank}, updated_at = NOW()
  WHERE id = ${teamId}
`;
```
