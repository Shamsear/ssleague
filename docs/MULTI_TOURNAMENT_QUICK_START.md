## 🎉 What's Working Now

✅ **Database:** Fully migrated with tournament support  
✅ **APIs:** All core APIs support multiple tournaments  
✅ **Frontend:** Tournament selector visible in navbar  
✅ **Testing:** All tests passing (100%)  
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Old code still works  

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (2 minutes)

### 1. Login to your app
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

### 2. Look at the navbar
You should see the **Tournament Selector** dropdown showing "🏆 Season 16 League"

### 3. Create a Cup tournament
Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tournaments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "season_id": "SSPSLS16",
    "tournament_type": "cup",
    "tournament_name": "FA Cup",
    "tournament_code": "FAC",
    "status": "active",
    "is_primary": false,
    "display_order": 2
  }'
```

### 4. Refresh the page
The dropdown should now show both tournaments!

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Tournament Selector in Navbar
- **Shows:** All tournaments for current season
- **Auto-selects:** Primary tournament (usually League)
- **Persists:** Selection saved to localStorage
- **Visible for:** Team managers, Committee admins, Super admins

### Switching Tournaments
1. Click the tournament dropdown in navbar
2. Select different tournament
3. All stats/fixtures automatically filter to that tournament

### Current State
Your app now has:
- **1 existing tournament:** SSPSLS16-LEAGUE
- **1 test tournament:** SSPSLS16-CUP (if you ran the curl command)

---

## 🎯 Using Tournament Context in Code

### In Any Component:
```tsx
import { useTournamentContext } from '@/contexts/TournamentContext';
import { usePlayerStats } from '@/hooks/useStats';

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { selectedTournamentId } = useTournamentContext();
  const { data: stats } = usePlayerStats({ tournamentId: selectedTournamentId });
  
  return <div>{/* Your UI */}</div>;
}
```

### Example: Update a Stats Page
```tsx
// Before (old way - still works!)
const { data } = usePlayerStats({ seasonId: 'SSPSLS16' });

// After (new way - tournament-aware)
const { selectedTournamentId } = useTournamentContext();
const { data } = usePlayerStats({ tournamentId: selectedTournamentId });
```

---

## 🔧 Managing Tournaments

### Via API (Recommended for now)

**Create Tournament:**
```bash
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS16",
  "tournament_type": "ucl",  // league | cup | ucl | uel | super_cup | league_cup
  "tournament_name": "Champions League",
  "tournament_code": "UCL",
  "status": "upcoming",      // upcoming | active | completed | cancelled
  "is_primary": false,
  "display_order": 3
}
```

**List Tournaments:**
```bash
GET /api/tournaments?season_id=SSPSLS16
```

**Update Tournament:**
```bash
PATCH /api/tournaments/SSPSLS16-UCL
{
  "status": "active",
  "start_date": "2025-11-01"
}
```

**Delete Tournament:**
```bash
DELETE /api/tournaments/SSPSLS16-UCL
```

### Via UI (Coming Soon)
A committee dashboard page for tournament management is planned.

## 📈 Creating a Complete Season

### Example: Season 16 with 4 Tournaments

```bash
# 1. League (already exists)
SSPSLS16-LEAGUE ✅

# 2. FA Cup
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS16",
  "tournament_type": "cup",
  "tournament_name": "FA Cup",
  "is_primary": false,
  "display_order": 2
}

# 3. Champions League
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS16",
  "tournament_type": "ucl",
  "tournament_name": "Champions League",
  "is_primary": false,
  "display_order": 3
}

# 4. Europa League
POST /api/tournaments
{
  "season_id": "SSPSLS16",
  "tournament_type": "uel",
  "tournament_name": "Europa League",
  "is_primary": false,
  "display_order": 4
}
```

Now users can switch between all 4 tournaments! 🎉
