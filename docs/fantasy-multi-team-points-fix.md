# Fantasy Multi-Team Player Points Fix

## Problem
Previously, when a real player was owned by multiple fantasy teams (e.g., 3 different teams drafted the same player), only ONE team would receive points when that player performed. The other teams would get nothing.

## Root Cause
The `processPlayer` function in `/api/fantasy/calculate-points` was using `LIMIT 1` when querying for teams that own a player:

```typescript
// OLD CODE - Only found first team
const squads = await sql`
  SELECT team_id
  FROM fantasy_squad
  WHERE league_id = ${fantasy_league_id}
    AND real_player_id = ${player_id}
  LIMIT 1  // ❌ Problem
`;

const fantasy_team_id = squads[0].team_id; // Only processed one team
```

## Solution
Updated the code to:
1. Remove the `LIMIT 1` to fetch **all** teams that own the player
2. Loop through each team and award points to all of them
3. Create separate `fantasy_player_points` records for each team

```typescript
// NEW CODE - Finds ALL teams
const squads = await sql`
  SELECT team_id
  FROM fantasy_squad
  WHERE league_id = ${fantasy_league_id}
    AND real_player_id = ${player_id}
  // No LIMIT - gets all teams ✅
`;

// Award points to EACH team
for (const squad of squads) {
  const fantasy_team_id = squad.team_id;
  
  // Create points record for this team
  await sql`INSERT INTO fantasy_player_points (...)`;
  
  // Update team's total points
  teamPointsMap.set(fantasy_team_id, currentPoints + total_points);
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Example Scenario:
- **Player A** is owned by **Team 1**, **Team 2**, and **Team 3**
- **Player A** scores **15 fantasy points** in a fixture

### Result:
✅ **Team 1** receives **15 points**  
✅ **Team 2** receives **15 points**  
✅ **Team 3** receives **15 points**

Each team gets the **full points independently** - this is standard fantasy league behavior.

## Database Records Created

When a player performs, the system now creates:
- One `fantasy_player_points` record per team that owns the player
- Each record is linked to a different `team_id`
- All records have the same `real_player_id`, `fixture_id`, and `total_points`

Example:
```sql
-- If Player "John Doe" (player_123) scores 15 points
-- and is owned by team_1, team_2, team_3:

fantasy_player_points:
  team_id: team_1, real_player_id: player_123, total_points: 15
  team_id: team_2, real_player_id: player_123, total_points: 15
  team_id: team_3, real_player_id: player_123, total_points: 15
```

## Logging
Added helpful console logging to track ownership:
```typescript
console.log(`Player ${player_name} is owned by ${squads.length} team(s)`);
```

This helps you monitor how many teams own each player when points are calculated.

## Files Changed
- `/app/api/fantasy/calculate-points/route.ts` - Updated `processPlayer` function

## Impact
- ✅ Fair point distribution for all teams
- ✅ No changes required to database schema
- ✅ Backward compatible (existing points records unchanged)
- ✅ Works automatically for future fixtures

## Testing
To test this fix:
1. Have multiple fantasy teams draft the same player
2. Enter fixture results where that player performs
3. Trigger point calculation via the API or UI
4. Verify all teams receive the same points for that player

## Notes
- This follows standard fantasy sports rules where player performance benefits all teams that own them
- Popular players will now benefit multiple teams simultaneously
- Draft strategy becomes more interesting - popular players are valuable to all who own them
