# ‚úÖ Phase 4 Complete - Leaderboard & Points Calculation Migrated!

## What's Been Accomplished

### Leaderboard System APIs
- ‚úÖ **`/api/fantasy/leaderboard/[leagueId]`** - PostgreSQL-powered leaderboard
  - Fetches team rankings with optimized SQL queries
  - Calculates last round points efficiently
  - Returns player counts and total points per team
  - Sorted by rank with proper NULL handling

### Points Calculation System
- ‚úÖ **`/api/fantasy/calculate-points`** - Fully migrated to PostgreSQL
  - Fetches fantasy leagues from PostgreSQL
  - Retrieves scoring rules from PostgreSQL
  - Checks drafted players in PostgreSQL fantasy_squad
  - Inserts points into fantasy_player_points table
  - Updates team totals (player_points, total_points)
  - Recalculates leaderboard ranks
  - All Firestore dependencies removed

### Player Pricing APIs
- ‚úÖ **`/api/fantasy/draft/prices` (GET)** - Fetch player prices from PostgreSQL
  - Returns all prices for a league with comprehensive fields
  - Includes price history and ownership data

- ‚úÖ **`/api/fantasy/draft/prices` (POST)** - Set/Generate player prices
  - Single player price updates with history tracking
  - Bulk price generation with pricing models (linear, exponential, tiered)
  - Upserts with ON CONFLICT handling
  - Pulls player data from tournament DB

## Technical Implementation

### Leaderboard Query Optimization
```sql
SELECT 
  ft.id as fantasy_team_id,
  ft.team_name,
  ft.owner_name,
  ft.total_points,
  ft.rank,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fs.real_player_id) as player_count,
  COALESCE(
    (
      SELECT SUM(fpp.total_points)
      FROM fantasy_player_points fpp
      WHERE fpp.fantasy_team_id = ft.id
        AND fpp.round_number = (
          SELECT MAX(round_number)
          FROM fantasy_player_points
          WHERE fantasy_team_id = ft.id
        )
    ),
    0
  ) as last_round_points
FROM fantasy_teams ft
LEFT JOIN fantasy_squad fs ON ft.id = fs.fantasy_team_id
WHERE ft.league_id = ${leagueId}
GROUP BY ft.id, ft.team_name, ft.owner_name, ft.total_points, ft.rank
ORDER BY ft.rank ASC NULLS LAST, ft.total_points DESC
```

### Points Calculation Flow
1. **Fetch league data** from PostgreSQL fantasy_leagues
2. **Get scoring rules** from fantasy_scoring_rules table
3. **Check tournament settings** (include_in_fantasy flag)
4. **Fetch fixture & matchup data** from tournament DB
5. **Process each player**:
   - Check if drafted in fantasy_squad
   - Verify points not already calculated
   - Calculate points breakdown (goals, conceded, result, MOTM, fines, clean sheet, substitution)
   - Insert into fantasy_player_points
6. **Update team totals** in fantasy_teams
7. **Recalculate ranks** ordered by total_points

### Rank Recalculation
```sql
-- Get teams ordered by points
SELECT id FROM fantasy_teams
WHERE league_id = ${fantasy_league_id}
ORDER BY total_points DESC, id ASC

-- Update each team's rank
UPDATE fantasy_teams
SET rank = ${rank}, updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = ${team_id}
```

### Player Pricing Features
- **Single price updates** with history tracking
- **Bulk generation** using pricing models:
  - **Linear**: ‚Ç¨1M per star rating
  - **Exponential**: ‚Ç¨1M √ó (stars ^ 1.5)
  - **Tiered**: 9+ stars = ‚Ç¨15M, 7+ = ‚Ç¨10M, 5+ = ‚Ç¨7M, 3+ = ‚Ç¨4M, else ‚Ç¨2M
- **Upsert logic** with ON CONFLICT for idempotent operations
- **Price change history** stored in JSONB field

## Frontend Integration

### Leaderboard Page
- Already uses `/api/fantasy/leaderboard/[leagueId]`
- Displays podium for top 3 teams
- Shows full rankings with stats
- Highlights user's own team
- No changes required - API swap is transparent

### Points Display
- Points automatically updated after fixtures
- Leaderboard refreshes with new rankings
- Last round points visible per team
