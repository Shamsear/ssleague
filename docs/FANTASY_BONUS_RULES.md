# Fantasy Bonus/Conditional Scoring Rules

## Overview

The bonus rules system allows you to create conditional scoring rules that apply extra points based on specific circumstances, such as:
- New player bonuses
- Scoring streaks
- Milestone achievements
- Position-specific bonuses
- Time-based bonuses
- Special match bonuses

## Setup

### 1. Run the Migration

```bash
python scripts/run-bonus-migration.py
```

This adds three new columns to the `scoring_rules` table:
- `is_bonus_rule` (BOOLEAN) - Whether this is a bonus rule
- `bonus_conditions` (JSONB) - The conditions for the bonus
- `priority` (INTEGER) - Rule priority for stacking

## How Bonuses are Applied

When calculating fantasy points:

1. **Base rules** are applied first (e.g., normal goal = 10 pts)
2. **Bonus rules** are checked in priority order
3. Multiple bonuses can stack (unless specified otherwise)
4. Final score = Base Points + All Applicable Bonuses

**Example**:
- Player: Defender who scores in 80th minute in their debut
- Base goal points: 10
- Position bonus (defender): +3
- New player bonus: +2
- Late goal bonus: +2
- **Total**: 17 points!
