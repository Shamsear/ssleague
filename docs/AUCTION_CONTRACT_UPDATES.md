# Auction Contract Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview
All auction processes now automatically set player contract information when players are won, including:
- Contract status (`active`)
- Contract ID (unique identifier)
- Contract start/end seasons
- Contract length

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Updated

### 1. Auction Settings (`auction_settings` table)
**New Field:** `contract_duration INTEGER DEFAULT 2`

- Stores default contract length for the season
- Default: 2 seasons
- Configurable per season via API

**API Endpoint:** `/api/auction-settings`
```json
{
  "season_id": "S16",
  "max_rounds": 25,
  "min_balance_per_round": 30,
  "contract_duration": 2  // NEW
}
```

---

### 2. Regular Auction Bid Processing (`lib/finalize-round.ts`)
**Updated:** `applyFinalizationResults()` function

**What's Set When Player Wins:**
```sql
UPDATE footballplayers SET
  is_sold = true,
  team_id = ${winner_team_id},
  acquisition_value = ${winning_bid},
  season_id = ${season_id},
  round_id = ${round_id},
  -- NEW CONTRACT FIELDS:
  status = 'active',
  contract_id = 'contract_${player_id}_${season_id}_${timestamp}',
  contract_start_season = ${current_season},
  contract_end_season = ${calculated_end_season},
  contract_length = ${contract_duration},
  updated_at = NOW()
```

**Contract End Season Calculation:**
- Reads `contract_duration` from `auction_settings`
- Default: 2 seasons
- Formula: `end_season = current_season + contract_duration - 1`
- Example: S16 with 2-season contract ‚Üí ends at S17

---

### 3. Tiebreaker Resolution (`lib/tiebreaker.ts`)
**Status:** No changes needed ‚úÖ

- When tiebreaker is resolved, it triggers re-finalization
- Re-finalization uses updated `finalizeRound()` which sets contracts
- Contract fields automatically populated via finalization flow

---

### 4. Bulk Auction Finalization (`app/api/admin/bulk-rounds/[id]/finalize/route.ts`)
**Updated:** Player assignment logic for single bidders

**What's Set:**
```sql
UPDATE footballplayers SET
  is_sold = true,
  team_id = ${winner_team_id},
  acquisition_value = ${base_price},
  -- CONTRACT FIELDS:
  status = 'active',
  contract_id = 'contract_${player_id}_${season_id}_${timestamp}',
  contract_start_season = ${current_season},
  contract_end_season = ${calculated_end_season},
  contract_length = ${contract_duration},
  season_id = ${season_id},
  round_id = ${round_id},
  updated_at = NOW()
```

---

### 5. Bulk Tiebreaker Resolution (`lib/finalize-bulk-tiebreaker.ts`)
**New File Created:** Helper function for bulk tiebreaker finalization

**Function:** `finalizeBulkTiebreaker(tiebreakerId)`

**What It Does:**
1. Gets tiebreaker winner details
2. Fetches contract_duration from auction_settings
3. Calculates contract end season
4. Updates `footballplayers` with full contract info
5. Marks tiebreaker as finalized

**Usage:**
```typescript
import { finalizeBulkTiebreaker } from '@/lib/finalize-bulk-tiebreaker';

const result = await finalizeBulkTiebreaker('tiebreaker_123');
// Returns: { success, winner_team_id, winning_amount, player_id }
```

## üìä Contract Field Schema

### `footballplayers` Table Contract Fields
```sql
status VARCHAR(50)                  -- 'active', 'free_agent', etc.
contract_id VARCHAR(255)           -- Unique: 'contract_{player}_{season}_{timestamp}'
contract_start_season VARCHAR(50)  -- e.g., 'S16'
contract_end_season VARCHAR(50)    -- e.g., 'S17' (for 2-season contract)
contract_length INTEGER            -- Number of seasons (e.g., 2)
```

---

## üîÑ Complete Flow Examples

### Example 1: Regular Auction
```
1. Auction Round Created (Season S16, contract_duration = 2)
2. Teams place bids
3. Round is finalized
4. Winner determined: Team A wins Player X for ¬£500

‚úÖ Player X updated:
   - status: 'active'
   - contract_id: 'contract_X_S16_1234567890'
   - contract_start_season: 'S16'
   - contract_end_season: 'S17'
   - contract_length: 2
   - acquisition_value: 500
   - team_id: 'team_a'
```

### Example 2: Bulk Auction
```
1. Bulk Round Created (Season S16, base_price = ¬£10)
2. Multiple teams bid on Player Y
3. Admin finalizes bulk round
4. Single bidders assigned immediately

‚úÖ Player Y (single bidder) updated:
   - status: 'active'
   - contract_id: 'contract_Y_S16_1234567891'
   - contract_start_season: 'S16'
   - contract_end_season: 'S17'
   - contract_length: 2
   - acquisition_value: 10
   - team_id: 'team_b'
```

### Example 3: Bulk Tiebreaker
```
1. Bulk Round has conflict (multiple bids on Player Z)
2. Tiebreaker created (Last Person Standing)
3. Teams compete, Team C wins at ¬£50
4. Admin calls finalizeBulkTiebreaker()

‚úÖ Player Z updated:
   - status: 'active'
   - contract_id: 'contract_Z_S16_1234567892'
   - contract_start_season: 'S16'
   - contract_end_season: 'S17'
   - contract_length: 2
   - acquisition_value: 50
   - team_id: 'team_c'
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration

### Run Migration Script
```bash
node scripts/add-contract-duration-to-auction-settings.js
```

**What It Does:**
1. Adds `contract_duration` column to `auction_settings` table
2. Sets default value of 2 seasons
3. Updates any NULL values to 2
4. Verifies changes

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (column added successfully)

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Create auction settings with custom contract_duration (e.g., 3 seasons)
- [ ] Run regular auction, verify player contract fields set correctly
- [ ] Create bulk auction, verify single bidder gets contracts
- [ ] Create bulk tiebreaker, resolve it, verify winner gets contracts
- [ ] Transfer a player, verify contract fields work with transfer system

### Verification Queries
```sql
-- Check if contract fields are set for won players
SELECT 
  player_id, name, team_id, status, 
  contract_id, contract_start_season, 
  contract_end_season, contract_length,
  acquisition_value
FROM footballplayers
WHERE is_sold = true
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check auction settings
SELECT * FROM auction_settings;
```

## üîó Integration with Transfer System

The auction contract updates work seamlessly with the existing player transfer system:

1. **Release Player:** Correctly reads `contract_start_season` and `contract_end_season` to calculate refund
2. **Transfer Player:** Replaces old contract with new one
3. **Swap Players:** Preserves original contracts (no changes)

**See:** `docs/PLAYER_TRANSFER_SYSTEM.md` for full transfer documentation

    }
  }
}
```

#### `POST /api/auction-settings`
**Request (updated):**
```json
{
  "season_id": "S16",

}
```

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Fractional season contracts (0.5, 1.5 seasons)
- [ ] Per-round contract duration override
- [ ] Contract auto-renewal system
- [ ] Contract extension API
- [ ] Mid-season contract renegotiation

---

## üìû Support

### Common Issues

**Q: Contract fields are NULL for old players**
A: Only newly won players get contracts. Run migration if needed.

**Q: How to change contract duration mid-season?**
A: Update via `POST /api/auction-settings` with new `contract_duration`.

**Q: What happens if auction_settings don't exist?**
A: Default value of 2 seasons is used automatically.

### Debug Mode
Check contract assignment in logs:
```bash
# Look for these log messages:
‚úÖ Updated team... budget...
Contract duration: 2 seasons
Contract end: S17
```
