  motm: is_motm ? +15 : 0,
  clean_sheet: goals_conceded === 0 ? +5 : 0,
  fines: fine_goals × (-5),

## ✅ What's Working

1. ✅ **League Creation** - Committee can create fantasy leagues
2. ✅ **Auto Team Creation** - Fantasy teams auto-created for all registered teams
3. ✅ **Draft Assignment** - Committee can assign players via API
4. ✅ **Points Calculation** - Automatic after match results
5. ✅ **Leaderboard Ranking** - Auto-updated after points calculation
6. ✅ **Scoring Rules** - Configurable point system

---

## 🚧 Next Steps (Step 2)

### API Endpoints Needed:
1. **Get Fantasy Team** - `GET /api/fantasy/teams/[teamId]`
2. **Get Leaderboard** - `GET /api/fantasy/leaderboard/[leagueId]`
3. **Get Available Players** - `GET /api/fantasy/players/available`
4. **Get Player Stats** - `GET /api/fantasy/players/[playerId]/stats`

### UI Pages Needed:
1. **Committee: Create League Page**
2. **Committee: Draft Entry Page**
3. **Team: My Fantasy Team Dashboard**
4. **Team: Leaderboard Page**
5. **Team: Player Stats Page**

---

## 🎯 Integration Point

**IMPORTANT:** After fixture results are saved, call:
```typescript
await fetch('/api/fantasy/calculate-points', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    fixture_id: fixtureId,
    season_id: seasonId,
    round_number: roundNumber
  })
});
```

Add this to the result entry success handler in:
- `/app/dashboard/team/fixture/[fixtureId]/page.tsx`
- `/app/dashboard/committee/team-management/fixture/[fixtureId]/page.tsx`
