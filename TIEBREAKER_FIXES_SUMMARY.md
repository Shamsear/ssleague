# Tiebreaker Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Input Field Auto-Reset Issue
**Problem:** Bid amount was resetting to `original_amount + 10` every 3 seconds (on auto-refresh)

**Solution:**
- Added `hasUserModifiedBid` state to track if user manually changed the bid
- Only set default bid if user hasn't modified it yet and bidAmount is empty
- All bid modification actions (typing, +/- buttons, Quick Bid) now set `hasUserModifiedBid = true`

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 38, 96-98, 368-370, 380-382, 394-396, 424-426)

### 2. âœ… Empty Input Shows "0" Instead of Nothing
**Problem:** When input was cleared, `parseInt(e.target.value) || 0` set it to 0

**Solution:**
- Changed `bidAmount` type from `number` to `number | ''`
- Updated onChange to: `setBidAmount(value === '' ? '' : parseInt(value))`
- Updated validation to handle both number and empty string

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 37, 139, 370)

### 3. âœ… Timer Shows "Expired" Immediately
**Problem:** `isExpired` and `timeRemaining` were calculated once using static `Date.now()`, not updated dynamically

**Solution:**
- Added `currentTime` state that updates every second via setInterval
- Created `getTimeRemaining()` function that calculates time remaining dynamically
- Created `isExpired()` function that checks expiration dynamically
- Timer now updates in real-time, counting down properly

**Files Modified:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 42, 89-90, 126-132, 179-192, 265)

### 4. âœ… Another Tie Creates New Tiebreaker (Not Excluded)
**Problem:** When teams bid the same amount in a tiebreaker, it was marking as "excluded" instead of creating another tiebreaker

**Solution:**
- Updated `resolveTiebreaker()` function to check if multiple teams have the same highest bid
- If there's another tie (tiedNewBids.length > 1):
  - Mark current tiebreaker as 'tied_again'
  - Create a NEW tiebreaker with the tied teams
  - New tiebreaker uses the new tied amount as the base
- Teams can now have multiple rounds of tiebreakers until there's a clear winner

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/tiebreaker.ts` (lines 280-330)

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Input Not Resetting
1. Open tiebreaker page
2. Type a custom amount (e.g., 150)
3. Wait 3-5 seconds for auto-refresh
4. **Expected:** Your amount of 150 should remain, not reset to original+10

### Test 2: Empty Input
1. Type an amount in the input
2. Clear the input completely (backspace/delete all)
3. **Expected:** Input should be empty, not show "0"

### Test 3: Timer Countdown
1. Open tiebreaker page
2. Watch the timer in the yellow alert box
3. **Expected:** Timer should count down second by second, not show "Expired" immediately

### Test 4: Console Logging (Debug Amount Submission)
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Type an amount (e.g., 250)
3. Submit the bid
4. **Expected:** Console should show:
   ```
   ðŸ’° Submitting tiebreaker bid: { amount: 250, bidAmount: 250, tiebreakerId: 'xxx' }
   ðŸ“¤ Sent bid amount: 250
   ```
5. If the console shows different amounts, there may be another issue

### Test 5: Multiple Tie Rounds
1. Create a tiebreaker (2+ teams bid same amount in a round)
2. Both teams submit the SAME new bid amount
3. Resolve the tiebreaker (as admin)
4. **Expected:** A NEW tiebreaker should be created (not excluded)
5. Teams should be able to bid again on the same player

## Known Behavior

- Tiebreakers have NO time limit (duration_minutes = NULL)
- Teams can only submit ONCE per tiebreaker
- Minimum new bid = original tied amount (not original+10)
- If teams tie again, a new tiebreaker is created automatically
- If only one team submits or one team has highest bid, that team wins

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/tiebreakers/[id]/submit
**Request:**
```json
{
  "newBidAmount": 150
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Bid submitted successfully",
  "data": {
    "tiebreakerId": "xxx",
    "newBidAmount": 150,
    "submittedAt": "2025-10-05T13:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

### POST /api/tiebreakers/[id]/resolve
**Request:**
```json
{
  "resolutionType": "auto"  // or "exclude"
}
```

**Response (Winner Found):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Tiebreaker resolved successfully",
  "data": {
    "winningTeamId": "team123",
    "winningAmount": 150,
    "status": "resolved"
  }
}
```

**Response (Another Tie):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Tiebreaker resolved successfully",
  "data": {
    "status": "tied_again",
    "newTiebreakerId": "new-tb-id"
  }
}
```

## Database Changes

### Tiebreakers Table - New Status
- **Status:** `tied_again` - When tiebreaker results in another tie and a new tiebreaker is created

### Existing Statuses:
- `active` - Tiebreaker is ongoing
- `resolved` - Clear winner determined
- `excluded` - Manually excluded by admin
- `tied_again` - **NEW** - Resulted in another tie, new tiebreaker created

## Date
2025-10-05

## Status
âœ… **ALL CHANGES COMPLETE**

## If Amount Submission Still Doesn't Work

Check the browser console for the log messages. The console will show:
1. What `amount` value is being prepared
2. What `bidAmount` state value is
3. What is actually being sent to the API

If console shows correct amount but API receives wrong amount, the issue is in the network layer or API.
If console shows wrong amount, the issue is in the frontend state management.
