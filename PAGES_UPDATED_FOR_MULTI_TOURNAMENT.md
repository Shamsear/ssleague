## 🔧 Pattern Used for All Updates

### Step 1: Import Tournament Context
```typescript
import { useTournamentContext } from '@/contexts/TournamentContext';
import { useTournament } from '@/hooks/useTournaments';
```

### Step 2: Get Selected Tournament
```typescript
const { selectedTournamentId } = useTournamentContext();
const { data: tournament } = useTournament(selectedTournamentId);
```

### Step 3: Update Stats Hook
```typescript
// Before
const { data } = usePlayerStats({ seasonId });

// After
const { data } = usePlayerStats({ 
  tournamentId: selectedTournamentId,
  seasonId // Fallback for backward compatibility
});
```

### Step 4: Update Header (Optional)
```typescript
<p>{tournament?.tournament_name || seasonName} - Rankings</p>
```

## 🎯 Pages That Auto-Benefit

These pages automatically work with tournaments because they use the updated hooks:

### From Team Hook Updates
Any page using `useTeamStats()` now filters by tournament:
- ✅ Team leaderboard
- ✅ Committee team standings
- ✅ Team comparison pages

### From Player Hook Updates
Any page using `usePlayerStats()` now filters by tournament:
- ✅ Player leaderboard
- ✅ Committee player stats
- ✅ Player profile pages

---

## 📝 Pages That May Need Updates

These pages might need manual updates if they display tournament-specific data:

### Medium Priority
- `app/dashboard/team/page.tsx` - Main team dashboard
- `app/dashboard/committee/page.tsx` - Main committee dashboard
- Fixture-related pages (if they display stats)

### Low Priority
- Historical/archive pages
- Export/report pages
- Admin pages

**Note:** Most pages will work automatically due to backward compatibility in the hooks!
