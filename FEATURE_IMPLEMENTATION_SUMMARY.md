  home_sub_penalty?: number; // 2 or 3
  // Same for away...
}
```

### 2. **Penalty/Fine Goals** ⚽➕

Away Team: 9 goals
  (Player: 6 + Sub Pen: 3 + Fine: 0)
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. ✅ `app/dashboard/team/fixture/[fixtureId]/page.tsx`
   - Added interfaces for substitution and penalty tracking
   - Added state management for subs and penalties
   - Implemented substitution logic with penalty calculation
   - Updated WhatsApp text generation
   - Added UI components (buttons, modal, inputs)
   - Updated save handler to persist penalty goals

### Key Functions Added:
```typescript
// Substitution handler
handleSubstitution(): 
  - Validates player selection
  - Calculates category-based penalty
  - Shows confirmation dialog
  - Updates matchup with new player
  - Saves to database

// Penalty calculation
Base: 2 goals
Category penalty: +1 if new_category < current_category
Total: 2-3 goals to opponent
```

### Score Calculation:
```typescript
// Player goals from matchups
homePlayerGoals = sum of home_goals

// Substitution penalties (received from opponent)
homeReceivedPenalties = sum of away_sub_penalty

// Fine/penalty goals
homeFineGoals = home_penalty_goals

// TOTAL
homeTotalGoals = homePlayerGoals + homeReceivedPenalties + homeFineGoals
```

## 📝 Database Schema Updates Needed

### Matchups Table/Collection:
Add columns (if using SQL) or fields (if using NoSQL):
```sql
home_original_player_id VARCHAR(255)
home_original_player_name VARCHAR(255)
home_substituted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
home_sub_penalty INT DEFAULT 0

away_original_player_id VARCHAR(255)
away_original_player_name VARCHAR(255)  
away_substituted BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
away_sub_penalty INT DEFAULT 0
```

### Fixtures Table/Collection:
Add columns/fields:
```sql
home_penalty_goals INT DEFAULT 0
away_penalty_goals INT DEFAULT 0
```

### API Endpoints to Update:
1. ✅ `PUT /api/fixtures/[id]/matchups` - Already handles matchup updates
2. ✅ `PATCH /api/fixtures/[id]` - Add penalty goals fields
3. ✅ Update any stats calculation APIs to EXCLUDE penalty goals

## 🎯 Business Logic

### Substitution Penalties:
1. **Purpose:** Discourage excessive substitutions
2. **Fairness:** Higher penalty if bringing in better player
3. **Tracking:** Original player tracked for statistics

### Penalty/Fine Goals:
1. **Purpose:** Penalize rule violations
2. **Types:** Late attendance, behavior, etc.
3. **Fairness:** Does NOT affect individual player stats
4. **Transparency:** Clearly shown in all displays

### POTM Calculation:
- ✅ Based ONLY on player goals and performance
- ✅ Penalty goals EXCLUDED
- ✅ Substitution penalties EXCLUDED
- ✅ Fair assessment of individual skill

## ✨ Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Substitution History Log**
   - Track all subs with timestamps
   - Show sub history on fixture page

2. **Penalty Goal Reasons**
   - Add optional reason field
   - Display reasons in breakdown

3. **Category Restrictions**
   - Optionally limit subs to same category
   - Configure per season

4. **Multiple Subs Per Match**
   - Allow multiple subs in same matchup
   - Track substitution chain

5. **Stats Dashboard**
   - Most substitutions by team
   - Most penalty goals received
   - Substitution impact analysis

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Run migrations to add new columns/fields
   - Set default values for existing records

2. **API Updates:**
   - Ensure PATCH endpoint handles new fields
   - Update stats calculation to exclude penalties

3. **Testing:**
   - Test on staging environment first
   - Verify score calculations
   - Check WhatsApp share format

4. **Documentation:**
   - Update user guide with new features
   - Add substitution rules to help section
   - Explain penalty goals to users

## 📞 Support

If issues arise:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database fields exist
3. Ensure API endpoints return new fields
4. Test with different browsers/devices

## ✅ Status: READY FOR TESTING
