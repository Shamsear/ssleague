## 💡 Recommendation

**Current Status: 35% Complete (21/60+ dialogs)**

We've successfully updated the **two highest-priority committee admin pages**.

**Options:**
1. ✅ Continue with Match Days (next most important)
2. ✅ Move to Team Fixture page (most used by end users)
3. ⏸️ Pause here - critical pages are done, others can be gradual

**My recommendation:** Continue with **Team Fixture Submission page** next, as it's the most frequently used page by end users.
