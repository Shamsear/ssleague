  status: 'free_agent',
  released_at: timestamp,
  released_by: user_uid,
  released_by_name: admin_name,
  release_refund: amount,
  previous_team_id: old_team_id

```

### Team Balance Updates

}
```

### Transaction Log

  player_id: string,
  player_name: string,
  team_id: string,
  season_id: string,

## üßÆ Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Release Player
- **Original Contract:** $500 (2 seasons)
- **Contract Progress:** 1 season completed, 1 remaining
- **Remaining Percentage:** 1/2 = 50%
- **Refund:** $500 √ó 0.50 √ó 0.70 = **$175**

### Example 2: Transfer Player
- **Old Team:** Receives $175 refund (from Example 1)
- **New Team:** Pays $400 (new contract value set by admin)
- **Net Effect:**
  - Old Team: +$175 balance
  - New Team: -$400 balance

### Example 3: Swap with Fee
- **Player A** ($500 value) swaps with **Player B** ($300 value)
- **Fee:** Team A pays $100 to Team B (to balance values)
- **Net Effect:**
  - Team A: -$100 balance, gains Player B
  - Team B: +$100 balance, gains Player A
