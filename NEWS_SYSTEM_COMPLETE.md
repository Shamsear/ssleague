## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Flow:

1. **Event Occurs** (e.g., 25th player registers)
2. **AI Generates Draft** → Gemini creates exciting news content
3. **Admin Reviews** → Visit `/admin/news` to see the draft
4. **Admin Publishes** → One-click publish
5. **Users See News** → Instantly visible on `/news` page

### Example:

```
User registers 50th player 
   ↓
AI writes: "🚀 SSPSLS16 HITS 50 REGISTRATIONS! Get In On The Action! ..."
   ↓
Draft saved to Firestore
   ↓
Admin publishes via /admin/news
   ↓
News visible on /news to all users
```

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Change AI Tone/Style:

Edit `lib/news/auto-generate.ts`:

```typescript
// Line 45-50: Player milestone prompts
case 'player_milestone':
  return `Write an EXCITING announcement that SSPSLS16 has reached ${milestoneNumber} registered players...`;
  // Change "EXCITING" to "Professional", "Casual", "Humorous", etc.
```

### Add New Event Types:

1. Add event to `lib/news/auto-generate.ts`:
   ```typescript
   case 'new_event_type':
     return `Your custom prompt here...`;
   ```

2. Call trigger in your API:
   ```typescript
   import { triggerNews } from '@/lib/news/trigger';
   
   await triggerNews('new_event_type', {
     season_id: 'SSPSLS16',
     custom_data: 'value',
   });
   ```

### Change AI Model:

Edit `lib/gemini/config.ts`:

```typescript
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ 
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp'  // Or 'gemini-pro', etc.
});
```

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### News not generating?

**Check:**
1. Gemini API key in `.env.local`
2. Server restarted after adding key
3. Console logs for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify API key
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### AI content quality issues?

**Solutions:**
1. Edit prompts in `lib/news/auto-generate.ts`
2. Switch to `gemini-pro` model (slower but better quality)
3. Add more context to prompts

### News not appearing on public page?

**Check:**
1. Is news published? (Check `/admin/news`)
2. Published news should have `is_published: true`
3. Try refreshing `/news` page
