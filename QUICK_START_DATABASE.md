## 🔧 Important Notes

### SQLite Table Name
- Your SQLite database should have a table named: **`players`**
- System auto-detects: `players`, `players_all`, `footballplayers`, `footballplayer`, `player`

### Firestore Collection
- Data is imported into: **`footballplayers`** collection
- All SQLite columns are preserved

### Required Firestore Rules
Make sure these rules are deployed in Firebase Console:

```javascript
match /footballplayers/{playerId} {
  allow read: if isAdmin();
  allow create: if isAdmin();
  allow update: if isAdmin();
  allow delete: if isAdmin();
}
```

## 📱 Performance

- **Recommended**: Test with small database first

## ⚠️ Before You Start

1. ✅ Ensure you're logged in as **committee_admin**
2. ✅ Create a **backup** of existing data (if any)
3. ✅ Test with a **small database** first
4. ✅ Verify **Firestore rules** are deployed

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### "Error reading database"
- Check file is a valid SQLite .db file
- Try opening in DB Browser for SQLite

### "No player tables found"
- Ensure table named `players` exists
- Check table has data

### "Missing or insufficient permissions"
- Deploy Firestore rules (see above)
- Verify user role is `committee_admin`

### Import seems slow
- Normal for 1000+ players
- Firestore has rate limits
- Be patient or reduce batch size
