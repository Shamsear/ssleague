## Database Tables

### `lineups`
Main table storing team lineups for each fixture.

```sql
- id (PK): lineup_{fixture_id}_{team_id}
- fixture_id (FK)
- team_id
- starting_xi: JSONB array of 5 player IDs
- substitutes: JSONB array of 2 player IDs
- classic_player_count: min 2 required
- is_locked: true after deadline
- warning_given: penalty tracking
- selected_by_opponent: if opponent selected lineup
```

### `lineup_substitutions`
Tracks all substitutions made during matches.

```sql
- lineup_id (FK)
- player_out: player substituted out
- player_in: player substituted in
- made_at: timestamp
- made_by: user who made the substitution
```

### `realplayerstats` (Modified)
Added columns for participation tracking.

```sql
- participation_type: 'started' | 'subbed_in' | 'subbed_out' | 'unused_sub'
- match_played: boolean (true only for started/subbed_in)
- lineup_id: reference to lineup used
```

```

## Deadline Logic

### Timeline
```
Round Created
    ‚Üì
Teams can submit/edit lineup
    ‚Üì
Round Starts (scheduled_date)
    ‚Üì
1-hour grace period (still editable)
    ‚Üì
Deadline: Round Start + 1 Hour
    ‚Üì
Lineups LOCKED üîí
```

### Checking Editability
```typescript
import { isLineupEditable } from '@/lib/lineup-validation';

const check = await isLineupEditable(fixtureId);
if (check.editable) {
  // Allow editing
} else {
  // Show: check.reason
}
```

---

## Validation Utilities

### Validate Lineup
```typescript
import { validateLineup } from '@/lib/lineup-validation';

const result = await validateLineup(
  { starting_xi: [...], substitutes: [...] },
  seasonId,
  teamId
);

if (!result.isValid) {
  console.log(result.errors);
}
```

### Check Submission Status
```typescript
import { hasSubmittedLineup } from '@/lib/lineup-validation';

const submitted = await hasSubmittedLineup(fixtureId, teamId);
```

### Get Fixture Lineup Status
```typescript
import { getFixtureLineupStatus } from '@/lib/lineup-validation';

const status = await getFixtureLineupStatus(fixtureId);
console.log(status.homeTeam.hasLineup); // true/false
console.log(status.awayTeam.hasLineup); // true/false
```

## Stats Calculation

### Participation Types

| Type | Match Played? | Stats Counted? | Use Case |
|------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| `started` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Player in starting XI and finished match |
| `subbed_in` | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Player came on as substitute |
| `subbed_out` | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | Player was substituted out |
| `unused_sub` | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No | Player was on bench but didn't play |

### Example Logic
```typescript
// When calculating player stats
if (participation_type === 'subbed_out' || participation_type === 'unused_sub') {
  // Don't count any stats
  match_played = false;
  goals = 0;
  assists = 0;
} else if (participation_type === 'started' || participation_type === 'subbed_in') {
  // Count all stats
  match_played = true;
  // Record actual stats
}
```

## Warning & Penalty System

### First Offense
- Team doesn't submit lineup
- System sends **warning**
- Team gets grace period to submit

### Second Offense
- Team still hasn't submitted
- **Opponent gets to select lineup**
- Opponent must follow same rules (2 classic players)
- Selected lineup is marked: `selected_by_opponent = true`

### Implementation
```typescript
// Check if team has warning
if (!lineup && !warning_given) {
  // First offense: give warning
  await giveWarning(teamId, fixtureId);
} else if (!lineup && warning_given) {
  // Second offense: let opponent select
  await notifyOpponent(opponentTeamId, fixtureId);
}
```

## Database Migration

Run the migration:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-lineup-migration.ts
```

Verify tables:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/verify-lineup-tables.ts
```

---

## Testing

### Test Lineup Submission
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lineups \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "fixture_id": "test_fixture",
    "team_id": "test_team",
    "starting_xi": ["p1","p2","p3","p4","p5"],
    "substitutes": ["p6","p7"],
    "submitted_by": "user123"
  }'
```

### Test Substitution
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/lineups/lineup_123/substitute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "player_out": "p1",
    "player_in": "p6",
    "made_by": "user123"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Lineup validation failed: Some players are not eligible"**
- Check players are registered in `player_seasons` table
- Verify `team_id` and `season_id` match

**"Lineup cannot be edited: Deadline has passed"**
- More than 1 hour has passed since round started
- Lineup is locked

**"Missing required fields"**
- Ensure all required fields in request body
- Check field names match exactly
