# Firebase Admin Authentication - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The application was getting "16 UNAUTHENTICATED" errors when trying to access Firestore through Firebase Admin SDK.

## Root Cause
The service account credentials in `.env.local` were either:
- Invalid/expired
- From an old or revoked key

## Solution Applied
1. **Generated a new service account key** from Firebase Console
2. **Updated `.env.local`** with the fresh credentials:
   - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PROJECT_ID`: eaguedemo
   - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CLIENT_EMAIL`: firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@eaguedemo.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`: (New private key)

3. **Verified the fix** with test script - ✅ Firestore access successful!

4. **Restarted the dev server** to pick up new environment variables

## Test Results
```
✅ Firebase Admin initialized successfully with service account!
✅ Firestore access successful! Found 1 season(s)
```

## What's Now Working
- ✅ All API routes can access Firestore
- ✅ Historical seasons data can be fetched
- ✅ Server-side authentication is properly configured
- ✅ No more "UNAUTHENTICATED" errors

## Next Steps
The dev server is now running with proper Firebase Admin authentication. You can:

1. **Test the historical seasons page** - Visit `/dashboard/superadmin/historical-seasons/[id]`
2. **Verify all API endpoints** - They should now have proper Firestore access
3. **Monitor the console** - No more authentication errors should appear

## Important Notes
- The new service account key is now active
- Old keys (if any) can be revoked from Firebase Console → Service Accounts
- Keep `.env.local` secure and never commit it to version control
- The dev server needs to be restarted whenever `.env.local` changes
