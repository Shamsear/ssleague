/**
 * WebSocket API Route
 * 
 * NOTE: Next.js App Router doesn't natively support WebSocket upgrades.
 * This is a placeholder for the WebSocket endpoint.
 * 
 * IMPLEMENTATION OPTIONS:
 * 
 * 1. Use a separate WebSocket server (Recommended for production):
 *    - Run a standalone Node.js WebSocket server (ws library)
 *    - Deploy it separately or use same server with custom server.js
 * 
 * 2. Use Server-Sent Events (SSE) as alternative:
 *    - One-way communication (server to client)
 *    - Works with standard HTTP
 *    - Good for real-time updates where client only needs to receive
 * 
 * 3. Use third-party service:
 *    - Pusher, Ably, or Socket.io hosted service
 *    - Easier to set up but costs money
 * 
 * For now, we'll return upgrade headers to signal WebSocket support.
