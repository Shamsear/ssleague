# 🎉 Implementation Complete - User Approval & Password Reset System

## ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### **1. User Approval System**

#### **How It Works:**
- **Teams (role='team')**: Require super admin approval before they can log in
  - Registration: `isApproved = false`
  - Cannot log in until approved by super admin
  
- **Committee Admins & Super Admins**: Auto-approved at registration
  - Registration: `isApproved = true`
  - Can log in immediately after registration

#### **Implementation Details:**
- **Files Modified:**
  - `types/user.ts` - Added approval fields
  - `lib/firebase/auth.ts` - Approval logic in registration and login
  
- **New Functions:**
  - `getPendingUsers()` - Get all users waiting for approval
  - `approveUser(uid, approvedBy)` - Approve a user account
  - `rejectUser(uid)` - Reject and delete user account

#### **User Interface:**
- **Super Admin Users Page** (`/dashboard/superadmin/users`)
  - Filter tabs: All, Pending, Approved
  - Approve/Reject buttons for pending team accounts
  - Visual status indicators
  - Automatic filtering by approval status

### **2. Password Reset Request System**

#### **How It Works (For ALL Users - Teams, Admins):**

**Step 1: User Requests Password Reset**
- User navigates to `/reset-password-request`
- Submits request with optional reason
- System creates pending request

**Step 2: Super Admin Reviews Request**
- Super admin sees request count in dashboard
- Navigates to `/dashboard/superadmin/password-requests`
- Views request details (user, email, reason, timestamp)

**Step 3: Super Admin Approves/Rejects**
- **Approve**: Generates unique reset link with 24-hour expiration
- **Reject**: Adds rejection notes, user must request again

**Step 4: User Resets Password**
- User clicks approved reset link: `/reset-password?token=xxx`
- System validates token (checks expiration)
- User enters new password
- Request marked as completed
- User redirected to login

#### **Implementation Details:**

1. `types/passwordResetRequest.ts` - Type definitions
