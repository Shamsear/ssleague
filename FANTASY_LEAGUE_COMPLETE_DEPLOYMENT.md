```

## 🚨 CRITICAL - You MUST Deploy Firestore Rules!

**The system will NOT work until you deploy the rules to Firebase Console!**

### How to Deploy:
1. Open Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Go to: Firestore Database → **Rules** tab
3. Copy ALL content from `firestore.rules` (lines 1-490)
4. Paste into Firebase Console editor
5. Click **"Publish"** button

OR use CLI:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Next.js 15+ Params Awaiting**
All dynamic route params now use:
```typescript
{ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
const { id } = await params;
```

### 2. **Removed Firestore Composite Index Requirements**
- Removed `.orderBy()` after `.where()` queries
- Sort in memory instead
- Applies to: my-team, leaderboard, teams

### 3. **Player Management System**
- Add players to teams
- Transfer between teams
- Swap players
- Remove from teams

### 4. **Custom Scoring Rules**
- Create new rule types dynamically
- Edit existing rules
- Delete rules
- Active/inactive toggle

## 📋 What Still Needs to Be Done:

### Priority 1: Enhanced Team Fantasy Page
The `/dashboard/team/fantasy/my-team` page needs to be updated with:

**Features to Add:**
1. **Expandable Players**
   - Click player to see match-by-match breakdown
   - Show: goals, assists, MOTM, clean sheets, etc.
   - Points per match with opponent info

2. **Other Teams View**
   - Toggle button to show/hide league teams
   - See competitor rankings and points
   - Compare team positions

3. **Enhanced Stats**
   - Player performance charts
   - Recent rounds visualization
   - Detailed breakdowns

**File to Update**: 
`app/dashboard/team/fantasy/my-team/page.tsx`

### Priority 2: Test End-to-End
1. Create fantasy league
2. Create teams
3. Draft/add players
4. Create custom scoring rules
5. Calculate points
6. View leaderboard
7. Transfer/swap players
