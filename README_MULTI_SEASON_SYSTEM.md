# Multi-Season Contract System

> **A complete dual-currency contract management system for Season 16+ with automated salary deductions, player ratings, and category management.**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Starting from **Season 16**, the system transitions from single-season to multi-season with:
- **2-season contracts** for all players
- **Dual currency**: $ (Dollar) for real players, € (Euro) for football players
- **Automated salaries**: Deducted per match or half-season
- **Dynamic ratings**: Star ratings (3★-10★) auto-update based on performance
- **Player categories**: Legend/Classic based on league-wide rankings
- **Contract lifecycle**: Automatic expiry and removal after 2 seasons

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run Migration (First Time Only)

Update historical seasons with `type: 'single'`:

```bash
npm run tsx scripts/add-season-type-to-historical.ts
```

### 2. Create Season 16 (Multi-Season)

```typescript
import { createSeason } from '@/lib/firebase/seasons';

const season16 = await createSeason({
  name: "Season 16",
  year: "2025",
  type: 'multi',
  dollar_budget: 1000,
  euro_budget: 10000,
  min_real_players: 5,
  max_real_players: 7,
  max_football_players: 25,
  category_fine_amount: 20,
  totalRounds: 38
});
```

### 3. Initialize Teams

```typescript
import { initializeMultiSeasonTeam } from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonTeams';

// After team registers for Season 16
await initializeMultiSeasonTeam(teamId, season16);
```

### 4. Assign Players

```bash
# Real Player (from WhatsApp auction)
POST /api/players/assign-contract
Body: {
  "playerId": "sspslpsl0001",
  "teamId": "team0001",
  "starRating": 8,
  "auctionValue": 250,
  "startSeasonId": "16"
}
```

### 5. Process Matches

```typescript
import { processMatchForRealPlayers } from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonPlayers';

// After match finalization
await processMatchForRealPlayers(
  teamAId, teamBId,
  teamAScore, teamBScore,
  teamAPlayerIds, teamBPlayerIds
);
```

## 💰 Dual Currency System

### Real Players (SS Members) - Dollar ($)

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Initial Balance | $1,000 |
| Player Slots | 5-7 (enforced) |
| Auction | Manual (WhatsApp) |
| Contract | 2 seasons |
| Salary Formula | `(value ÷ 100) × stars ÷ 10` |
| Deduction Timing | After each match |

**Example:**
```
10★ player bought for $300
Salary = ($300 ÷ 100) × 10 ÷ 10 = $3 per match
```

### Football Players - Euro (€)

| Feature | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Initial Balance | €10,000 |
| Player Slots | 25 max |
| Auction | In-app |
| Contract | 2 seasons |
| Salary Formula | `value × 10%` |
| Deduction Timing | Mid-season & end |

**Example:**
```
Messi bought for €1,000
Salary = €1,000 × 10% = €100 per half-season
```

---

## ⭐ Star Rating System

### Initial Points by Rating

| Stars | Points | Stars | Points |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| 3★ | 100p | 7★ | 210p |
| 4★ | 120p | 8★ | 250p |
| 5★ | 145p | 9★ | 300p |
| 6★ | 175p | 10★ | 350-400p |

### Points Updates

- **After each match**: Points ± Goal Difference
- **Maximum change**: ±5 points per match
- **Formula**: `1 GD = 1 point` (capped at ±5)

### Auto-Recalculation

Star ratings automatically recalculate based on updated points after every match.

---

## 🏆 Category System

### Categories

- **Legend**: Top 50% of players (by points, league-wide)
- **Classic**: Bottom 50% of players

### Match Requirements

- **Minimum 2 Legend** players
- **Minimum 3 Classic** players
- **Fine if not met**: $20 (deducted from dollar_balance)

### Auto-Updates

Categories recalculate league-wide after every match based on current points.

## 🛠️ Core Functions

### Salary Calculations
```typescript
import { calculateRealPlayerSalary, calculateFootballPlayerSalary } from '@/lib/contracts';

const realSalary = calculateRealPlayerSalary(300, 10); // $3
const footballSalary = calculateFootballPlayerSalary(1000); // €100
```

### Contract Management
```typescript
import { 
  createRealPlayerContract,
  calculateContractEndSeason,
  isContractExpired 
} from '@/lib/contracts';

const endSeason = calculateContractEndSeason("16"); // "17"
const expired = isContractExpired("17", "18"); // true
```

### Points & Stars
```typescript
import { 
  updatePlayerPoints,
  calculateStarRating 
} from '@/lib/contracts';

const newPoints = updatePlayerPoints(250, 3); // 253 (GD +3)
const stars = calculateStarRating(250); // 8★
```

### Categories
```typescript
import { 
  updateAllPlayerCategories,
  validateMatchLineup 
} from '@/lib/contracts';

const categories = updateAllPlayerCategories(players);
const validation = validateMatchLineup(playerIds, categories);
// { valid: true, legendCount: 2, classicCount: 3 }
```

### Team Operations
```typescript
import {
  initializeMultiSeasonTeam,
  deductDollarBalance,
  getTeamBalances
} from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonTeams';

await initializeMultiSeasonTeam(teamId, season);
await deductDollarBalance(teamId, 250);
const balances = await getTeamBalances(teamId);
```

### Player Operations
```typescript
import {
  assignRealPlayerWithContract,
  processMatchForRealPlayers,
  removeExpiredContracts
} from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonPlayers';

await assignRealPlayerWithContract({ playerId, teamId, starRating, auctionValue, startSeasonId });
await processMatchForRealPlayers(teamA, teamB, scoreA, scoreB, playersA, playersB);
await removeExpiredContracts(currentSeasonId);
```

- [x] Firebase operations
- [x] API endpoints
- [x] Migration script
- [x] Documentation

### Frontend (To Do ⏳)

- [ ] Team registration with dual balance initialization
- [ ] Real player assignment admin form
- [ ] Team dashboard dual balance display
- [ ] Player cards with contract/stars/category

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests
```typescript
// Test salary calculations
calculateRealPlayerSalary(300, 10) === 3 ✓
calculateFootballPlayerSalary(1000) === 100 ✓

// Test contract end season
calculateContractEndSeason("16") === "17" ✓

// Test points update
updatePlayerPoints(250, 3) === 253 ✓
updatePlayerPoints(250, 7) === 255 ✓ // Capped at +5

// Test star rating
calculateStarRating(250) === 8 ✓
```

### Integration Tests
1. Create Season 16 with type: 'multi'
2. Register teams and verify dual balances
3. Assign players and verify contracts
4. Run match and verify salary deduction
5. Trigger mid-season and verify deduction
6. End season and verify contract expiry

---

## 📊 Key Differences: Single vs Multi

| Feature | Single (1-15) | Multi (16+) |
|---------|---------------|-------------|
| **Currency** | Single | Dual ($ & €) |
| **Contracts** | 1 season | 2 seasons |
| **Salaries** | None | Per match / half-season |
| **Star Ratings** | Static | Dynamic (auto-update) |
| **Categories** | None | Legend/Classic |
| **Expiry** | N/A | Automatic |

---

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Always check season type** before operations
2. **Use preview endpoints** (GET) before actual operations (POST)
3. **Monitor balances** to prevent negative values
4. **Recalculate categories** after bulk match updates
5. **Schedule expiry** at season transitions
6. **Backup data** before running batch operations
7. **Test with dummy data** before production use

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Player not assigned
- Check team has enough dollar balance
- Verify star rating is 3-10
- Ensure season is type: 'multi'

### Issue: Salary not deducted
- Verify `processMatchForRealPlayers` is called
- Check player has `salary_per_match` field
- Ensure team has positive dollar_balance

### Issue: Categories not updating
- Confirm `recalculatePlayerCategories` is called
- Check players have active contracts
- Verify points are being updated

### Issue: Contract not expiring
- Call `removeExpiredContracts` with current season ID
- Check `contract_end_season` < current season
- Verify `contract_status` is 'active'
