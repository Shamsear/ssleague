## 🚨 CRITICAL NEXT STEPS (You Must Do These):

### Step 1: Deploy Firestore Rules (REQUIRED!)
**Without this, NOTHING will work!**

```bash
# Option 1: Firebase Console (Recommended)
1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Click "Firestore Database" → "Rules" tab
4. Copy ALL content from firestore.rules file
5. Paste into editor
6. Click "Publish"

# Option 2: Firebase CLI
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Status:** ❌ **NOT DEPLOYED YET**
**Impact:** All fantasy features will show "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors

---

### Step 2: Update Team My-Team Page (Optional Enhancement)
**Location:** `app/dashboard/team/fantasy/my-team/page.tsx`
**Current:** Basic player list
**Missing:**
- Expandable players (click to see match-by-match stats)
- Other teams view
- Enhanced visualizations

**To Fix:** This would require replacing the entire file content with the enhanced version.
