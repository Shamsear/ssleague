## 🎨 Image Specifications

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Model** | FLUX.1-schnell (fast, high quality) |
| **Resolution** | 1200x630 px (social media optimized) |
| **Format** | PNG |
| **Generation Time** | 2-3 seconds |
| **Style** | Professional sports graphics |

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **News generated** → `lib/news/auto-generate.ts`
2. **Prompt created** → `lib/images/generate.ts` (optimized for event type)
3. **Image generated** → Hugging Face FLUX.1-schnell API
4. **Image saved** → Base64 data URL (stored in Firebase)
5. **Displayed** → `/news` and `/admin/news` pages

---

## 🛠️ Customization

### Change Image Style:

Edit `lib/images/generate.ts`, line 54:

```typescript
const style = 'professional sports graphic, modern design, vibrant colors, high quality';
```

Change to:
- `'minimalist, clean, simple design'`
- `'cartoon style, fun, playful'`
- `'photorealistic, dramatic lighting'`
- `'retro 80s sports poster'`

### Change Image Size:

Edit `lib/images/generate.ts`, line 22-23:

```typescript
width = 1200,  // Change to 1920 for HD
height = 630,  // Change to 1080 for HD
```

### Use Different Model:

Edit `lib/images/generate.ts`, line 24:

```typescript
model = 'black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell',
```

Change to:
- `'stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0'` (slower, different style)
- `'black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev'` (better quality, slower)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Images not generating?

**Check:**
1. Hugging Face token in `.env.local`
2. Server restarted after adding token
3. Console logs for errors

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify token is set
echo $HUGGING_FACE_TOKEN

# Restart server
npm run dev
```

### Image generation fails?

**Possible causes:**
- Invalid token → Get a new one from Hugging Face
- Network issues → Check internet connection
- Rate limit hit → Wait a minute (unlikely with 30k/month)

**Solution:** Images are optional! If generation fails, news still works perfectly (just without images).

### Images look bad?

**Solutions:**
1. Edit prompts in `lib/images/generate.ts` (lines 56-89)
2. Try FLUX.1-dev model (better quality, slower)
3. Increase resolution (1920x1080)

## 📈 Monitoring Usage

### Check Hugging Face Dashboard:
1. Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/billing
2. See your usage stats
3. Monitor free tier limit

**You'll likely use < 1% of free tier!**

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Easy Additions:
1. **Upload to Firebase Storage** - Currently using data URLs (inline base64)
2. **Image caching** - Store generated images to avoid regenerating
3. **Multiple styles** - Different image styles per category
4. **Image editing** - Let admins upload custom images

### Advanced:
1. **Video generation** - Animated news graphics
2. **Dynamic overlays** - Add text overlays with scores/stats
3. **Brand templates** - Consistent league branding
4. **Social media auto-post** - Share with images to Twitter/Discord
