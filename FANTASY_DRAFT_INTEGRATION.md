## 🎯 How It Works

### For Committee Admins:

1. **Enable Fantasy for Teams** → `/dashboard/committee/fantasy/enable-teams` - Bulk enable or individually toggle fantasy participation
2. **Create Fantasy League** → Creates fantasy teams for all participating teams
3. **Configure Draft Settings** → Set budget, squad size, position minimums
4. **Set Player Prices** → Manually or auto-generate based on ratings
5. **Configure Transfers** → Set transfer window, limits, and point costs
6. **Activate Draft** → Open draft for **teams** to select their own players
7. **Monitor & Manage** → Track standings, adjust scores if needed

### For Team Users:

**Current System (Admin Assigns):**
- Committee admin manually assigns players via "Draft Entry" page
- Teams view their assigned squad at `/dashboard/team/fantasy/my-team`

**⚠️ MISSING - Team Self-Draft:**
Teams currently **cannot** draft players themselves. The system needs a team-facing draft interface where:
- Teams can browse available players
- Draft players within their budget
- Build their squad following position rules
- Make transfers during transfer windows

## 🗑️ Removed Files

The following standalone pages were removed as they're now integrated:
- ❌ `/app/draft/` - Draft functionality now in committee fantasy pages
- ❌ `/app/transfers/` - Transfer functionality now in committee fantasy pages
- ❌ `/app/admin/` - Admin functionality now in committee fantasy pages

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

The system is **ready to use**! Here's a typical workflow:

1. Committee creates a fantasy league for the season
2. Committee configures draft settings and player pricing
3. Committee activates the draft
4. Committee assigns players to fantasy teams
5. Season starts, fantasy points are calculated automatically
6. Committee opens transfer windows at designated times
7. Teams make transfers through the manage-players interface
8. Committee monitors standings and manages the league

---

## 📝 Notes

- All pages use the existing fantasy league system (`fantasy_leagues`, `fantasy_teams`, `fantasy_players` collections)
- Draft and transfer features are integrated with existing scoring and point calculation
- The UI follows your existing design system with glassmorphic cards and gradient styles
- Real-time updates can be added later using WebSockets if needed

**Integration Complete!** 🎉
