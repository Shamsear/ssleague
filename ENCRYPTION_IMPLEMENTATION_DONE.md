# Blind Bidding Encryption - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## What Was Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Encryption Library (`lib/encryption.ts`)
- AES-256-GCM encryption (military-grade security)
- Functions: `encryptBidData()` and `decryptBidData()`
- Tamper-proof authenticated encryption

### 2. ‚úÖ Environment Configuration
- Added `BID_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to `.env.local`
- Generated secure 256-bit encryption key

### 3. ‚úÖ Bid Creation API (`app/api/team/bids/route.ts`)
- **Before**: Stored `player_id` and `amount` in plain text
- **After**: Encrypts sensitive data into `encrypted_bid_data` column
- Teams can place bids, but data is encrypted immediately

### 4. ‚úÖ Finalization Process (`lib/finalize-round.ts`)
- Decrypts bids only during finalization
- Processes encrypted data to determine winners
- No one can see bid details until round completes

## Next Step: Database Migration

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You need to run this SQL in your Neon console:

```sql
ALTER TABLE bids ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS encrypted_bid_data TEXT;
```

### How to Apply:
1. Go to https://console.neon.tech
2. Select your database
3. Go to SQL Editor
4. Paste and run the command above

## How It Works

### When a Team Places a Bid:
```
Player ID: "2341"
Amount: ¬£500
         ‚Üì ENCRYPT
encrypted_bid_data: "a3f2d1...e9c8b7" (gibberish)
```

### What's Stored in Database:
```
id: uuid
team_id: "abc123" (visible - which team bid)
round_id: "xyz789" (visible - which round)
encrypted_bid_data: "a3f2d1e...9c8b7" (ENCRYPTED - what they bid)
status: "active"
created_at: timestamp
```

### When Round is Finalized:
```
encrypted_bid_data: "a3f2d1...e9c8b7"
         ‚Üì DECRYPT (only during finalization)
Player ID: "2341"
Amount: ¬£500
         ‚Üì PROCESS
Winner determined!
```

## Security Features

‚úÖ **Database admins cannot see bids** - Even with direct DB access, they only see encrypted text

‚úÖ **Teams cannot spy** - No API exposes encrypted data

‚úÖ **Tamper-proof** - AES-GCM authentication detects any modifications

‚úÖ **Audit trail** - Timestamps show when bids were placed (but not the content)

## Testing

### Test Encryption:
```javascript
const { encryptBidData, decryptBidData } = require('./lib/encryption');

const original = { player_id: '2341', amount: 500 };
const encrypted = encryptBidData(original);
const decrypted = decryptBidData(encrypted);

console.log('Original:', original);
console.log('Encrypted:', encrypted);
console.log('Decrypted:', decrypted);
console.log('Match:', JSON.stringify(original) === JSON.stringify(decrypted));
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed:
- Encryption library created
- Bid creation API updated
- Finalization process updated
- Encryption key generated

### ‚è≥ Pending:
1. **Run database migration** (add encrypted_bid_data column)
2. **Test with a new round** (place encrypted bids)
3. **Verify finalization** (decrypt and process correctly)

### üîÆ Future (Optional):
- Remove old `player_id` and `amount` columns (once fully migrated)
- Add bid viewing API for teams to see only their own bids (decrypted)
- Key rotation strategy for long-term security

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep the encryption key safe!**
- It's in `.env.local` (never commit to git)
- Losing it means existing encrypted bids cannot be decrypted
- Use same key across all environments accessing the same database

‚ö†Ô∏è **Backwards Compatibility**
- Old bids (if any) still have plain-text player_id/amount
- New bids have encrypted_bid_data
- Both formats work during transition

## What Happens Next

1. **Run the migration SQL** in Neon console
2. **Restart your Next.js server** to load new encryption key
3. **Create a new round** and have teams place bids
4. **Verify encryption**: Check the database - you should see encrypted gibberish in `encrypted_bid_data` column
5. **Finalize the round**: Bids will be decrypted and winners determined

Your auction is now truly blind! üéØüîí
