# ✅ Committee Admin Features - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added **"🔍 View Details"** button to every fixture card
- ✅ Links to `/dashboard/committee/team-management/fixture/{fixtureId}`
- ✅ Button appears for all fixtures (completed and pending)

### 2. **Result Editing Backend** 🔄
**File:** `app/api/fixtures/[fixtureId]/edit-result/route.ts`

**Complete Workflow:**
1. ✅ **Reverts old stats** - Calls `/api/realplayers/revert-fixture-stats`

3. ✅ **Updates matchups** - Saves new scores to database
4. ✅ **Updates fixture totals** - Recalculates home/away scores
5. ✅ **Applies new stats** - Calls `/api/realplayers/update-stats`
6. ✅ **Applies new points** - Calls `/api/realplayers/update-points`
7. ✅ **Logs in audit trail** - Records edit with reason & user

**Features:**
- Complete stat reversion (goals, wins/losses, matches played)
- Complete point reversion (lifetime & season points)
- Star rating recalculation
- Category recalculation (league-wide)
- Salary recalculation (if star rating changed)
- Full audit log with old→new values

### 3. **Committee Fixture Page Updates** 💾
**File:** `app/dashboard/committee/team-management/fixture/[fixtureId]/page.tsx`

**Enhanced Save Functionality:**
- ✅ Prompts for edit reason
- ✅ Confirms before saving
- ✅ Calls edit-result API
- ✅ Shows success/error messages
- ✅ Reloads data after save
- ✅ Exits edit mode automatically

## How It Works

### Example: Edit Result Workflow

**Scenario:** Team A submitted 5-2 but actual was 3-2

**Steps:**
1. Committee admin opens fixture detail page
2. Clicks **"✏️ Edit Results"**
3. Changes scores inline:
   - Matchup 1: 3-1 → 2-1
   - Matchup 2: 2-1 → 1-1
4. Clicks **"💾 Save Changes"**
5. Enters reason: "Score correction - video review"
6. Confirms action

**Backend Process:**
```
1. Fetch old matchups (5-2)
2. Revert old stats:
   - Team A: -3 points, -1 win
   - Team B: +0 points, -1 loss
   - Goals: Team A -5, Team B -2
   - Points: Team A -3pts, Team B +3pts
3. Update matchups (3-2)
4. Apply new stats:
   - Team A: +3 points, +1 win
   - Team B: +0 points, +1 loss
   - Goals: Team A +3, Team B +2
   - Points: Team A +1pt, Team B -1pt
5. Recalculate star ratings
6. Recalculate categories (league-wide)
7. Log in audit trail
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Stats corrected
- ✅ Points recalculated
- ✅ Star ratings updated
- ✅ Categories reassigned
- ✅ Audit trail shows edit
