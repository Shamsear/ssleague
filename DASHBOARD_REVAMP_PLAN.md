# Team Dashboard Complete Revamp Plan

## Current Issues
- 1792 lines of code (too long, hard to maintain)
- Scattered sections with inconsistent styling
- Multiple design patterns mixed together
- Poor visual hierarchy
- Difficult to find important information

## New Design System

### 1. **Hero Section** ✅ DONE
- Team logo + name
- Key stats (Balance, Squad, Avg Rating)
- Season badges
- Contract info

### 2. **Quick Actions Grid** ✅ DONE
- 4 category cards (Auction, Team, Competition, Planning)
- Dynamic content (show active rounds count, etc.)
- Icon-based navigation

### 3. **Priority Alerts** (NEEDS REDESIGN)
- Tiebreakers (if any)
- Urgent actions

### 4. **Active Content Tabs** (NEEDS COMPLETE REDESIGN)
Instead of long scrolling sections, use TABS:
- **Tab 1: Active Auctions** (Rounds + My Bids combined)
- **Tab 2: My Squad** (Team roster with filters)
- **Tab 3: Results** (Round results)
- **Tab 4: Overview** (Stats dashboard)

### 5. **Modern Components**
- Use cards with hover effects
- Consistent spacing (gap-4, gap-6)
- Glass-morphism design
- Smooth transitions
- Mobile-first responsive

## Implementation Strategy

Since the file is 1792 lines, I'll:
1. Keep the logic/state (lines 1-527)
2. Completely redesign the render section (lines 528-1877)
3. Use modern tab system instead of long scroll
4. Reduce code by 40% through better component structure
