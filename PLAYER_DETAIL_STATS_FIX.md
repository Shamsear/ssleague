## 📝 About Season Names

### Season Name Display:
- Shows `season_name` from `realplayerstats` if available
- Falls back to "Season 1", "Season 2", etc. if not set
- Also displays team name badge (e.g., "WHITETM ASGARDIANS")
- Shows category badge (Legend/Classic)

### If Season Names Show as "Season 1", "Season 2":
This means the `season_name` field in `realplayerstats` documents is not populated.

**To fix:** The `season_name` should be denormalized into `realplayerstats` when creating season stats. This is already done in newer seasons via the APIs, but older season data may not have it.

**Temporary Solution:** The fallback naming (Season 1, 2, 3...) helps identify different seasons by order.
