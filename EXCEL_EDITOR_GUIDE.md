- In-memory editing with batch save
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX

### Data Flow

2. **Edit**: Update local state with React hooks
3. **Save**: POST all changes to `/api/seasons/historical/[id]/bulk-update`
4. **Commit**: Firestore batch writes for atomic updates

### API Endpoint
**POST** `/api/seasons/historical/[id]/bulk-update`

  "teams": [
    {

## Database Collections

### Teams Collection
- **Collection**: `teams`
- **Fields Updated**: 
  - `team_name`, `team_code`, `owner_name`, `owner_email`
  - `initial_balance`, `current_balance`
  - `updated_at` (auto-generated)

### Players Collections
The system intelligently handles the two-collection architecture:

1. **realplayers** - Permanent player info
   - `name`, `display_name`, `email`, `phone`
   - `psn_id`, `xbox_id`, `steam_id`

2. **realplayerstats** - Season-specific data
   - `category`, `team`, `role`, `notes`
   - `stats` object with all performance metrics

## Security

- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth token required
- **Authorization**: Super Admin role only
- **Validation**: Server-side data validation
- **Atomic Updates**: Firestore batch writes prevent partial updates

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Saves**: Save changes frequently to avoid data loss
2. **Search First**: Use search to find records before scrolling
3. **Tab Navigation**: Use Tab key for efficient cell navigation
4. **Bulk Edits**: Make all related changes before saving
5. **Review Before Save**: Double-check changes before committing

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab**: Move to next cell
- **Shift + Tab**: Move to previous cell
- **Enter**: Same as Tab (move to next cell)
- **Ctrl + F**: Focus search bar (browser default)
- **Esc**: Cancel current edit
