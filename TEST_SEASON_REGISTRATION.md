## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Season in Firestore**
   - Go to Firebase Console > Firestore Database
   - Add a document to the `seasons` collection

       "name": "Test Season 2024",
       "short_name": "TS24",
       "status": "upcoming",
       "is_active": false,
       "starting_balance": 15000,
       "participant_count": 0,
       "created_at": [Firebase Timestamp],
       "updated_at": [Firebase Timestamp]
     }
     ```
   - Note the document ID (e.g., `abc123xyz`)

2. **Create a Test Team Account**

## API Testing with cURL

### Test API Directly (Season Details)
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/seasons/<seasonId>
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "abc123xyz",
    "name": "Test Season 2024",
    "short_name": "TS24",
    "is_active": false,
    "status": "upcoming",
    "starting_balance": 15000
  }
}
```

### Test API Directly (Registration)
Note: This requires a valid JWT token in cookies, so it's easier to test via the UI.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized - No token provided"
- **Solution**: Make sure you're logged in
- Check browser cookies for 'token'

### Issue: "Season not found"
- **Solution**: Verify the season document exists in Firestore
- Check the season ID in the URL

### Issue: "Team not found"
- **Solution**: Verify the user document exists in Firestore
- Check that the user has role='team'

### Issue: Page doesn't load
- **Solution**: 
  - Check Next.js dev server is running
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify Firebase config is correct

### Issue: "Internal server error"
- **Solution**: 
  - Check server logs in terminal
  - Verify JWT_SECRET is set in .env.local
  - Check Firebase security rules

## Security Testing

### Test 1: Token Validation
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Go to Application > Cookies
3. Delete or modify the 'token' cookie
4. Try to register for a season
5. **Expected**: "Unauthorized - Invalid token" error

### Test 2: Role Validation
1. Login as a non-team user
2. Manually navigate to registration URL
3. **Expected**: Redirected to dashboard or "Unauthorized" error

## Performance Testing

1. Open browser DevTools > Network tab
2. Access registration page
3. Check:
   - Page loads within 2 seconds
   - API calls complete quickly
   - No unnecessary requests
