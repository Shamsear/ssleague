## 🎯 Impact on Committee Workflow

### Before Tournament Integration
- ❌ Committee sees mixed stats from all tournaments
- ❌ Cannot separate League vs Cup performance
- ❌ Awards calculated across all competitions
- ❌ No way to manage tournaments independently

### After Tournament Integration
- ✅ Committee can switch between tournaments
- ✅ View League standings separately from Cup
- ✅ Track player awards per tournament
- ✅ Analyze performance per competition
- ✅ Make tournament-specific decisions

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Pattern

All committee pages follow the same pattern:

```typescript
// 1. Import tournament context
import { useTournamentContext } from '@/contexts/TournamentContext';
import { useTournament } from '@/hooks/useTournaments';

// 2. Get selected tournament
const { selectedTournamentId } = useTournamentContext();
const { data: tournament } = useTournament(selectedTournamentId);

// 3. Update stats hooks
const { data } = usePlayerStats({ 
  tournamentId: selectedTournamentId,
  seasonId: userSeasonId // Fallback
});

// 4. Display tournament name (optional)
<h2>{tournament?.tournament_name} Stats</h2>
```

## 📋 Committee Admin Pages NOT Updated

These pages are not tournament-related and don't need updates:

### Auction Management
- Auction Settings
- Rounds Management
- Player Selection
- Bulk Rounds

### Database Management
- Import/Export
- Database Tools

### Team Management (Non-Stats)
- Team Registration
- Team Contracts
- Real Players Assignment

### Other Features
