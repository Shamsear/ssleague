## üöÄ How to Use the System

### Step 1: Run Migration Script

First, update historical seasons with type: 'single'

```bash
npm run tsx scripts/add-season-type-to-historical.ts
```

### Step 2: Create Season 16 (Multi-Season)

```typescript
import { createSeason } from '@/lib/firebase/seasons';

const season16 = await createSeason({
  name: "Season 16",
  year: "2025",
  type: 'multi',
  dollar_budget: 1000,
  euro_budget: 10000,
  min_real_players: 5,
  max_real_players: 7,
  max_football_players: 25,
  category_fine_amount: 20,
  totalRounds: 38
});
```

### Step 3: Register Teams

When teams register, initialize dual balances:

```typescript
import { initializeMultiSeasonTeam } from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonTeams';

// After team creation
if (season.type === 'multi') {
  await initializeMultiSeasonTeam(teamId, season);
}
```

### Step 4: Assign Real Players (WhatsApp Auction)

Use the API endpoint:

```bash
POST /api/players/assign-contract

Body:
{
  "playerId": "sspslpsl0001",
  "teamId": "team0001",
  "starRating": 8,
  "auctionValue": 250,
  "startSeasonId": "16"
}
```

Or use the function directly:

```typescript
import { assignRealPlayerWithContract } from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonPlayers';

await assignRealPlayerWithContract({
  playerId: 'sspslpsl0001',
  teamId: 'team0001',
  starRating: 8,
  auctionValue: 250,
  startSeasonId: '16'
});
```

### Step 5: Process Match Results

After match finalization:

```typescript
import { processMatchForRealPlayers } from '@/lib/firebase/multiSeasonPlayers';

await processMatchForRealPlayers(
  teamAId,
  teamBId,
  teamAScore,
  teamBScore,
  teamARealPlayerIds,
  teamBRealPlayerIds
);
```

This automatically:
- Updates player points (¬±GD, max ¬±5)
- Recalculates star ratings
- Deducts salaries from dollar_balance
- Recalculates categories league-wide

### Step 6: Mid-Season Trigger

At halfway point (e.g., after round 19):

```bash
POST /api/seasons/16/mid-season-salaries
```

This deducts football player salaries from euro_balance.

### Step 7: Season End - Expire Contracts

When Season 18 starts:

```bash
POST /api/seasons/18/expire-contracts
```

This removes all contracts ending in Season 17.

## üìä System Features Summary

### Dual Currency

## üìã What Still Needs UI

These features have backend logic but need frontend forms:

1. **Season Creation Form** - Add multi-season field inputs
2. **Team Registration** - Auto-initialize dual balances
3. **Real Player Assignment Form** - New admin page needed
4. **Team Dashboard** - Display dual balances ($  & ‚Ç¨)
5. **Player Cards** - Show contract, stars, points, category
6. **Match Submission** - Validate lineup categories
7. **Admin Triggers** - Buttons for mid-season & contract expiry

---

- Monitor Firebase usage during batch operations
- Consider adding a cron job for automatic mid-season/expiry triggers
- Keep documentation updated as you add UI components
