# Admin Transaction Management

## Overview
The Admin Transaction Management system allows administrators to issue fines, bonuses, and manual adjustments to team balances. All transactions are automatically logged and appear in team transaction histories.

## Features

### Transaction Types

1. **Fine** - Deduct money from a team
   - Always uses positive amounts (e.g., 200 = deduct $200)
   - Deducted from team balance
   - Common uses: Disciplinary actions, rule violations, late submissions

2. **Bonus** - Add money to a team
   - Always uses positive amounts (e.g., 500 = add $500)
   - Added to team balance
   - Common uses: Rewards, achievements, special events

3. **Adjustment** - Manual balance correction
   - Can be positive (add) or negative (deduct)
   - Used for corrections or special circumstances
   - Example: +100 adds $100, -50 deducts $50

## Transaction Logging

All transactions are automatically logged to the `transactions` table:

### Fine Transaction
```typescript
{
  team_id: 1,
  season_id: 1,
  currency_type: 'football',
  transaction_type: 'fine',
  amount: -200,
  reason: 'Late lineup submission',
  balance_after: 9800,
  metadata: {
    issued_by: 'Admin Name',
    previous_balance: 10000,
    new_balance: 9800
  }
}
```

### Bonus Transaction
```typescript
{
  team_id: 1,
  season_id: 1,
  currency_type: 'football',
  transaction_type: 'bonus',
  amount: 500,
  reason: 'Tournament winner bonus',
  balance_after: 10500,
  metadata: {
    issued_by: 'Admin Name',
    previous_balance: 10000,
    new_balance: 10500
  }
}
```

### Adjustment Transaction
```typescript
{
  team_id: 1,
  season_id: 1,
  currency_type: 'football',

  amount: -100,
  reason: 'Balance correction',
  balance_after: 9900,
  metadata: {
    adjusted_by: 'Admin Name',
    previous_balance: 10000,
    new_balance: 9900
  }
}
```

## Team Transaction View

### Filtering
Teams can filter their transaction history by type:
- All Transactions
- Auction Wins
- Salaries
- Fines
- Bonuses
- Adjustments
- Transfer Payments
- Transfer Compensation
- Swap Fees Paid
- Swap Fees Received
- Release Refunds
- Real Player Fees
- Initial Balance

### Transaction Icons
Each transaction type has a unique icon:
- üí∞ Salary
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fine
- üî® Auction
- üë§ Real Player Fee
- üéÅ Bonus
- üîß Adjustment
- ‚û°Ô∏è Transfer Payment
- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Transfer Compensation
- üîÑ Swap Fee Paid
- üîÅ Swap Fee Received
- ‚Ü©Ô∏è Player Release Refund
- üè¶ Initial Balance

## Best Practices

### When to Use Each Type

**Fine:**
- Rule violations
- Late submissions
- Disciplinary actions
- Policy infractions

**Bonus:**
- Achievement rewards
- Tournament prizes
- Special event bonuses
- Performance incentives

**Adjustment:**
- Correcting errors
- Technical issues
- Special circumstances
- Balance fixes

### Reason Guidelines
Always provide clear, specific reasons:
- ‚úÖ "Late lineup submission for Match 5"
- ‚úÖ "Won tournament championship"
- ‚úÖ "Correction for duplicate auction charge"
- ‚ùå "Fine" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "Adjustment" (no context)

### Amount Guidelines
- Keep amounts reasonable and fair
- Document large transactions
- Use adjustments for corrections only
- Always double-check preview before applying

## Database Schema

### Transactions Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  team_id INT NOT NULL,
  season_id INT NOT NULL,
  currency_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  transaction_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  amount NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  reason TEXT NOT NULL,
  balance_after NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Teams Table (Updated Balance)
```sql
-- Balance is updated directly
UPDATE teams 
SET balance = balance + amount 
WHERE id = team_id;
```

## Security Considerations

1. **Admin Only** - Only admin users should access `/admin/transactions`
2. **Audit Trail** - All transactions include who issued them
3. **Reason Required** - Transparency for all balance changes
4. **Validation** - Prevents negative balances and invalid amounts
5. **Metadata** - Stores previous/new balance for verification

## Integration Points

### Files Modified/Created
1. `app/api/admin/transactions/fine/route.ts` - Fine API endpoint
2. `app/api/admin/transactions/bonus/route.ts` - Bonus API endpoint
3. `app/api/admin/transactions/adjustment/route.ts` - Adjustment API endpoint
4. `app/admin/transactions/page.tsx` - Admin UI
5. `app/dashboard/team/transactions/page.tsx` - Enhanced with filters
6. `lib/transaction-logger.ts` - Logger functions (already existed)

### Dependencies
- `@/lib/neon` - Database connection
- `@/lib/transaction-logger` - Transaction logging functions
- Next.js 14 App Router
- PostgreSQL with JSONB support
