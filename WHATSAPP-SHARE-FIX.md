## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. **Added Dynamic Open Graph Meta Tags** (`app/news/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamically injects Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags
- Updates on page load with article-specific data
- Includes image, title, description

### 2. **Created OpenGraph Image Generator** (`app/news/[id]/opengraph-image.tsx`)
- Generates dynamic OG images for each news article
- Uses the news article's image if available
- Creates branded fallback image if no image exists
- Server-side generation for WhatsApp compatibility

---

## 🔑 Required Configuration

Add this to your `.env` file (both local and production):

```env
# Your deployed site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

For **local development**:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

For **production** (Vercel):
Add the environment variable in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` = `https://your-domain.vercel.app`
3. Redeploy

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Locally:
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open a news article
3. Share URL to WhatsApp

### Test on Production:
1. Deploy to Vercel
2. Open a news article on your live site
3. Share URL to WhatsApp
4. WhatsApp will scrape: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/news/[id]/opengraph-image`

---

## 🔍 How It Works

### For WhatsApp:
1. When you share a news URL, WhatsApp makes a server request to your site
2. Next.js serves the `opengraph-image.tsx` at `/news/[id]/opengraph-image`
3. This file:
   - Fetches the news article data
   - Returns the news image URL (if exists)
   - OR generates a branded fallback image
4. WhatsApp caches and displays this image as the thumbnail

### For Other Apps:
- Meta tags are injected dynamically for in-browser sharing
- Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. use the Open Graph tags
- Works for web-based sharing

---

## 📊 What's Included in the Thumbnail

When sharing a news article, WhatsApp will show:
- **Image**: News article image (or branded fallback)
- **Title**: News headline
- **Description**: Summary or first 160 characters
- **URL**: Direct link to article

---

## 🎨 Fallback Image

If a news article doesn't have an image, the system generates:
- Blue gradient background (your brand colors)
- Soccer ball emoji
- Article title
- "SS Premier Super League" branding
- Size: 1200x630px (optimal for social media)

---

## 🚀 Automatic Features

✅ Works automatically for all news articles  
✅ No manual configuration per article needed  
✅ Uses actual news images when available  
✅ Branded fallback for articles without images  
✅ Compatible with WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn  
✅ Server-side rendered for instant social media scraping

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### WhatsApp Not Showing Thumbnail?

1. **Check deployment**: Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set in Vercel
2. **Test the OG image**: Visit `https://your-domain.com/news/[article-id]/opengraph-image`
3. **Clear WhatsApp cache**: WhatsApp caches thumbnails. Try:
   - Share a different article first
   - Wait a few minutes
   - Share your original article again
4. **Verify image URL**: Make sure `news.image_url` in database is a valid public URL
