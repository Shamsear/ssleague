## API Endpoints

### GET `/api/team/players`
**Authentication**: Required (session cookie)
**Returns**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "players": [...],
    "count": 0
  }
}
```

### GET `/api/team/dashboard?season_id={seasonId}`
**Authentication**: Required (session cookie)
**Returns**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "team": {...},
    "activeRounds": [...],
    "activeBids": [...],
    "players": [...],
    "tiebreakers": [...],
    "bulkTiebreakers": [...],
    "activeBulkRounds": [...],
    "roundResults": [...],
    "seasonParticipation": {...},
    "stats": {...}
  }
}
```

## Fixed Issues

1. **"Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON"**
   - **Cause**: API endpoints were returning HTML error pages instead of JSON
   - **Fix**: Updated APIs to use proper server-side authentication with Admin SDK
   - **Result**: APIs now return proper JSON responses

2. **Missing Authentication**
   - **Cause**: Dashboard API was using client-side Firebase without proper auth
   - **Fix**: Implemented session cookie verification with Firebase Admin SDK
   - **Result**: Secure, server-side authenticated API calls
