# Fantasy PostgreSQL Migration - Phase 2 Complete ✅

## Overview
Phase 2 migrates all team-facing features from Firestore to PostgreSQL, allowing teams to draft players, view their squad, and see available players.

## Completed in Phase 2

### Backend APIs Migrated ✅

1. **`/api/fantasy/teams/my-team`**
   - Gets fantasy team from `fantasy_teams` table
   - Retrieves squad from `fantasy_squad`
   - Aggregates points from `fantasy_player_points`
   - Calculates recent performance by round

2. **`/api/fantasy/players/available`**
   - Checks league from `fantasy_leagues`
   - Gets drafted players from `fantasy_squad`
   - Returns undrafted players from Firestore `realplayer`

3. **`/api/fantasy/draft/settings`**
   - Returns league budget and squad size limits
   - Simplified from complex Firestore draft settings

4. **`/api/fantasy/draft/player`** (NEW)
   - Drafts player to `fantasy_squad`
   - Records in `fantasy_drafts` for history
   - Updates team budget in `fantasy_teams`
   - Validates budget, squad size, duplicates

### Frontend Pages Updated ✅

1. **Draft Page** (`/dashboard/team/fantasy/draft`)
   - Uses `/api/fantasy/draft/player` instead of `/api/fantasy/draft/select`
   - Sends `user_id` instead of `fantasy_team_id`
   - Works with PostgreSQL league settings

## Database Flow

### Drafting a Player
```
1. Frontend → POST /api/fantasy/draft/player
   {
     user_id, real_player_id, player_name,
     position, team_name, draft_price
   }

2. API queries:
   - fantasy_teams (get user's team)
   - fantasy_leagues (get budget/size limits)
   - fantasy_squad (check current squad)

3. Validations:
   ✓ Player not already drafted
   ✓ Squad size < max_squad_size
   ✓ draft_price ≤ remaining budget

4. Insert into:
   - fantasy_squad (active squad)
   - fantasy_drafts (history)
   - Update fantasy_teams.budget_remaining

5. Return: success + new squad info
```

### Viewing Squad
```
1. Frontend → GET /api/fantasy/teams/my-team?user_id={uid}

2. API queries:
   - fantasy_teams WHERE owner_uid = user_id
   - fantasy_squad WHERE team_id = team_id
   - fantasy_player_points (aggregate by player)

3. Return:
   - team: { id, league_id, team_name, total_points, rank }
   - players: [{ name, position, team, price, points }]
   - recent_rounds: [{ round, points }]
```

### Getting Available Players
```
1. Frontend → GET /api/fantasy/players/available?league_id={id}

2. API queries:
   - fantasy_leagues (get season_id)
   - fantasy_squad (get drafted player IDs)
   - Firestore realplayer (all players for season)

3. Filter out drafted players

4. Return: available_players[]
```

## What Now Works

### For Teams ✅
- ✅ View fantasy squad with stats
- ✅ See available players to draft
- ✅ Draft players within budget
- ✅ Real-time budget tracking
- ✅ Squad size validation
- ✅ Duplicate player prevention

### Data Integrity ✅
- ✅ No Firestore fantasy collections used
- ✅ All data in PostgreSQL
- ✅ Budget calculations accurate
- ✅ Squad limits enforced
- ✅ Draft history preserved

## Still Using Firestore
- ✅ `realplayer` collection (permanent player data)
- ✅ `teams` collection (permanent team data)
- ✅ `seasons` collection (season info)

These SHOULD stay in Firestore as they're permanent/real data.

## Next Phase: Transfers & Leaderboard

### Priority 3: Transfer System
Still need to migrate:
- `/api/fantasy/transfers/player` - Execute transfer
- `/api/fantasy/transfers/settings` - Transfer window settings
- `/api/fantasy/transfers/team` - Transfer history
- Transfer windows table management
- Frontend transfers page

### Priority 4: Leaderboard & Points
Still need to migrate:
- `/api/fantasy/leaderboard/[leagueId]` - Rankings
- `/api/fantasy/calculate-points` - Points calculation
- Points sync from fixtures
- Leaderboard caching

| fantasy_leagues | ✅ Active | League settings |
| fantasy_teams | ✅ Active | Team records & budgets |
| fantasy_players | 🔄 Future | Player pricing (not yet used) |

## Key Changes from Firestore

### Simplified Structure
- No separate `fantasy_draft_settings` collection
- Settings stored in `fantasy_leagues` table
- No position limits (as requested)
- Simpler draft API

### Better Validation
- Database-level foreign keys
- UNIQUE constraints on IDs
- DECIMAL types for money
- Cascading deletes

### Performance
- Indexed queries
- Aggregated points in single query
- Connection pooling
- No Firestore read limits

## Notes

- League IDs: `fantasy-{season_id}`
- Squad IDs: `squad_{team_id}_{player_id}_{timestamp}`
- Draft IDs: `draft_{team_id}_{player_id}_{timestamp}`
- Budget stored as DECIMAL(12,2)
- All monetary values in millions (e.g., 5.5 = €5.5M)

## Commands

```bash
# View fantasy teams
psql $FANTASY_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM fantasy_teams;"

# View squads
psql $FANTASY_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM fantasy_squad;"

# View leagues
psql $FANTASY_DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM fantasy_leagues;"
```
