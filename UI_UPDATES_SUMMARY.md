### Creating a Multi-Season (Season 16+)

1. **Super Admin** ‚Üí Create Season
   - Select "Multi-Season" type
   - Configure budgets and limits
   - Create season

2. **Teams Register**
   - Teams automatically get dual balances ($1000, ‚Ç¨10000)

3. **Committee** ‚Üí Assign Real Players
   - Go to "Assign Real Player" page
   - Select team, enter player details
   - System auto-calculates salary and contract end

4. **During Season**
   - After each match: System deducts real player salaries automatically
   - At mid-season (e.g., Round 19): Admin triggers mid-season salary payment

5. **End of Season**
   - Admin goes to "Expire Contracts" page
   - Processes expired contracts
   - Teams ready for new season
