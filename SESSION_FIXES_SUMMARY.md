# Session Fixes Summary - 2025-10-05

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Firebase Token Expiration - All API Calls
**Problem:** Firebase ID tokens expire after 1 hour, causing 401 errors on team dashboard and admin pages

**Solution:**
- Updated `app/dashboard/team/RegisteredTeamDashboard.tsx` to use `fetchWithTokenRefresh`
- Updated `app/dashboard/committee/page.tsx` to use `fetchWithTokenRefresh`
- Updated `app/dashboard/committee/rounds/page.tsx` to use `fetchWithTokenRefresh`
- Token now automatically refreshes and retries on 401 errors

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/team/RegisteredTeamDashboard.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/committee/page.tsx` (lines 10, 136, 146)
- `app/dashboard/committee/rounds/page.tsx` (lines 9, 138)
- `TOKEN_EXPIRATION_AUTO_REFRESH_FIX.md` (documentation)

---

### 2. ✅ Team Dashboard API - Missing team_seasons Table
**Problem:** SQL query tried to JOIN with `team_seasons` table in Neon, but that table doesn't exist (team data is in Firestore)

**Solution:**
- Removed `team_seasons` JOIN from SQL query
- Fetch team names separately from Firebase Firestore after getting tiebreaker data
- Batch Firebase queries for efficiency

**Files:**
- `app/api/team/dashboard/route.ts` (lines 96-168)

---

### 3. ✅ Minimum Bid Amount Update
**Problem:** Minimum bid was £100, but should be £10

**Solution:**
- Updated database constraint from `amount >= 100` to `amount >= 10`
- Updated frontend validation in team round page
- Updated input min attribute from "100" to "10"
- Created and ran migration script

**Files:**
- `database/migrations/blind-bidding-system.sql` (line 37)
- `database/migrations/update-minimum-bid-amount.sql` (new)
- `scripts/update-minimum-bid.js` (new)
- `app/dashboard/team/round/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 540-541, 657)
- `MINIMUM_BID_UPDATE.md` (documentation)
- `MINIMUM_BID_10_SUMMARY.md` (quick reference)

**Migration Executed:** ✅ Successfully updated database constraint

---

### 4. ✅ Committee Dashboard - Active Rounds with Tiebreakers
**Problem:** Committee dashboard didn't show active rounds or their tiebreaker details

**Solution:**
- Added state variables for active rounds, tiebreakers, and loading
- Added useEffect to fetch active rounds and tiebreakers from APIs
- Created new "Active Rounds" UI section with:
  - Round stats (bids, teams, tiebreakers, status)
  - Tiebreaker details (player, position, teams involved, amount)
  - Real-time updates every 5 seconds
  - Links to manage rounds and tiebreakers

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/committee/page.tsx` (lines 21-23, 127-171, 420-543)

---

### 5. ✅ Tiebreaker Page - Input Auto-Reset Issue
**Problem:** Bid amount was resetting to `original_amount + 10` every 3 seconds when page auto-refreshed

**Solution:**
- Added `hasUserModifiedBid` state to track manual changes
- Only set default bid if user hasn't modified it yet AND bidAmount is empty
- All bid modification actions now set `hasUserModifiedBid = true`

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 38, 96-98, 368-370, 380-382, 394-396, 424-426)

---

### 6. ✅ Tiebreaker Page - Empty Input Shows "0"
**Problem:** When input was cleared, `parseInt(e.target.value) || 0` set it to 0 instead of empty

**Solution:**
- Changed `bidAmount` type from `number` to `number | ''` to allow empty string
- Updated onChange to: `setBidAmount(value === '' ? '' : parseInt(value))`
- Updated validation to handle both number and empty string types

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 37, 139, 370)

---

### 7. ✅ Tiebreaker Page - Timer Shows "Expired" Immediately
**Problem:** `isExpired` and `timeRemaining` were calculated once using static `Date.now()`, not updated dynamically

**Solution:**
- Added `currentTime` state that updates every second via setInterval
- Created `getTimeRemaining()` function that calculates time remaining dynamically
- Created `isExpired()` function that checks expiration dynamically
- Timer now updates in real-time, counting down properly

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/team/tiebreaker/[id]/page.tsx` (lines 42, 89-90, 126-132, 179-192, 265)

---

### 8. ✅ Tiebreaker Resolution - Create New Tiebreaker on Tie
**Problem:** When teams bid the same amount in a tiebreaker, it was marking as "excluded" instead of creating another tiebreaker

**Solution:**
- Updated `resolveTiebreaker()` function logic:
  - Check if multiple teams have the same highest bid (tiedNewBids.length > 1)
  - If another tie: Mark current as 'tied_again', create NEW tiebreaker
  - New tiebreaker uses the new tied amount as the base
- Teams can now have multiple rounds of tiebreakers until there's a clear winner

**Files:**
- `lib/tiebreaker.ts` (lines 280-330)

**New Database Status:** `tied_again` - When tiebreaker results in another tie

---

### 9. ✅ Admin Rounds Page - Debug Tiebreakers Display
**Problem:** Admin rounds page might not be showing tiebreakers correctly

**Solution:**
- Added console logging to debug tiebreakers API response
- Logs show:
  - API response data
  - Number of tiebreakers fetched
  - Each tiebreaker's round_id and player_name
  - Grouped tiebreakers by round_id
- Helps identify if tiebreakers are being fetched but not displayed

**Files:**
- `app/dashboard/committee/rounds/page.tsx` (lines 140, 143, 148, 155, 158)
